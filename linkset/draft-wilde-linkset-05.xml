        <abstract>
            <t>This specification defines two media types for representing sets of links and a link relation type for referring to sets of links. The media types can be used to represents links in a standalone fashion, in one case in the native format as used in the HTTP "Link" header field, and in the other case in a JSON-based format. The link relation type can be used to point at a resource that provides a set of links.</t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
            <t>Resources on the Web often use typed Web Links <xref target="RFC8288"/>, either 
               as an embedded part of resource representations, for example using the &lt;link&gt; 
               element for HTML representations, or by using the "Link" header field in HTTP response 
               headers for representations using any media type. In some cases, however, 
               providing links in this manner is impractical or impossible.</t> 
            <t>To that end, this specification defines two document formats and associated media types 
               to represent a set of links. It also defines the "linkset" relation type that a 
               resource can use to support discovery of another resource that conveys 
               links, including but not limited to links in which the former resource participates.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
            <t>This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link target" as defined in 
                <xref target="RFC8288"/>. 
                These terms respectively correspond with "Context IRI" and "Target IRI" as used in RFC 5988
                <xref target="RFC5988"/>. Although defined as IRIs, in common scenarios they are also URIs.</t> 
            <!--
            <t>Additionally, this specification uses the following terms for types of resources involved 
                in providing links by reference:</t> 
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>A "link set resource" is a resource that conveys a set of links. <xref target="linkset-formats"/> 
                   defines two representations for a set of links, based on the abstract link model defined in 
                    <xref target="RFC8288"/>.</t>
                <t>An "origin resource" is a resource that participates in one or more links provided 
                   by a link set resource. An origin resource can support discovery of an associated 
                   link set resource by using the relation type defined in <xref target="linkset-link-relation"/>.
                   As such, from the perspective of the origin resource, the links conveyed by the link set resource 
                   are provided by reference.</t>

        </section>
        <section title="Scenarios" anchor="scenarios">
            <t>The following sections outline scenarios in which providing links by means of a standalone document 
                instead of in an HTTP "Link" header field or as links embedded in the resource representation is advantageous or necessary. 
                It is important to keep in mind that, when providing links by means of a standalone representation, 
                other links can still be provided by value (i.e., it is possible combine various mechanisms of how links are conveyed).</t>
            <section title="Third-Party Links" anchor="third-party">
                <t>In some cases, it is useful that links pertaining to a resource are provided 
                    by a server other than the one that hosts the resource. For example, this allows:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t>Providing links in which the resource is involved not just as link context but 
                        also as link target.</t> 
                    <t>Providing links pertaining to the resource that the server hosting that 
                        resource is not aware of.</t>
                    <t>External management of links pertaining to the resource in a special-purpose link
                        management service.</t>
                </list></t>
                <t>In such cases, a third-party resource can provide a set of links pertaining to the resource. 
                    This third-party resource may be managed by the same or by another custodian as the resource. 
                    For clients intent on consuming links pertaining to the resource, it would be beneficial if:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t>The resource would be able to link to the third-party resource that provides the links using a registered 
                    link relation type.</t>
                    <t>The third-party resource would provide the links in a document that is compliant with a registered media type.</t>
                </list></t>
                    <!--
                <t>In order for the server hosting the resource to provide an up-to-date and complete set of links 
                    in which that resource participates, 
                    the server would need to obtain the links from the third-party resource, 
                    and embed them in the resource's 
                    representations prior to responding to a client. Doing so would increase latency and load, 
                    which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on consuming these links. Providing links by means of a standalone document, 
                    removes the server-to-server communication and resulting overhead required to obtain
                    links. Instead, the consumer of the resource can decide if they need the additional links as context
                    for the resource and only access the third-party resource that provides the links if they do.</t>
                    -->
            </section>
            <section title="Challenges Writing to HTTP Link Header Field" anchor="header-writing">
                <t>In some cases, it is not straightforward to write links to the HTTP "Link" header field
                    from an application. This can, for example, be the case because not all 
                    required link information is available to the application or because the 
                    application does not have the capability to directly write HTTP headers. 
                    In such cases, providing links by means of a standalone document can be a solution. 
                    Making the third-party resource that provides these links discoverable can be achieved by means of a 
                    typed link.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Large Number of Links" anchor="link-volume">
                <t>When conveying links in an HTTP "Link" header field, it is possible for the size of the HTTP 
                    response header to become unpredictable. This can be the case when links are determined 
                    dynamically dependent on a range of contextual factors. It is possible to statically configure 
                    a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by specifying an upper boundary 
                    for their size. But when the number of links is 
                    unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is challenging.</t>
                <t>HTTP <xref target="RFC7231"/> defines error codes related to excess communication 
                    by the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI Too Long"), but no specific
                    error codes are defined to indicate that response header content exceeds the upper boundary that can 
                    be handled by the server, and thus it has been truncated.
                    As a result, applications take counter measures aimed at controlling 
                    the size of the HTTP "Link" header field, for example by limiting the links they provide to those 
                    with select relation types, thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header field to clients. 
                    Providing links by means of a standalone document overcomes challenges related to the unpredictable 
                    nature of the extent of HTTP "Link" header fields.</t>
                <t>In more extreme scenarios it is conceivable that the number of links to be conveyed becomes so 
                    large that even a standalone document would become too large. 
                    This could be the case for highly popular resources, and when links are provided in which such 
                    resources participates as both link context and link target.
                    In such cases, the links could be delivered incrementally, for example, by means of a paged resource model  .</t>

            <t>A set of links can be represented by serializations that support 
                conveying both link contexts and link targets. 
                This section specifies two document formats based on the abstract model  
                specified in Section 2 of <xref target="RFC8288"/> 
                that defines a link as consisting of a "link context", a "link relation type", a "link target", 
                and optional "target attributes".</t>

                    of the HTTP "Link" header field as specified in <xref target="RFC8288"/>.</t>
                <t>The format defined in <xref target="linkset-json"/> is based on JSON and thus
                does not have the character encoding limitations of HTTP header fields.</t>
            
            <section title="HTTP Link Document Format: application/linkset" anchor="linkset-native">
                <t>This document format is identical to the payload of the

                    <xref target="RFC8288"/>, more specifically by  
                    its ABNF production rule for "Link" and subsequent ones.</t>

                            these target attributes follow different occurrence and value patterns.  
                            In the JSON representation, these attributes MUST be conveyed as additional

        <section title='The "linkset" Relation Type for Linking to a Set of Links' anchor="linkset-link-relation">
            <t>The target of a link with the "linkset" relation type provides a set of links, 
                including links in which the resource that is the link context participates.</t>
            <t>A link with the "linkset" relation type MAY be provided in the header and/or 
                the body of a resource's representation. It may also be discovered by other means, such as through
                client-side information.</t>
            <t>A resource MAY provide more than one link with a "linkset" relation type. 
                Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed using different 
                media types, or to different sets of links, potentially provided by different third-party services.</t> 
            <!-- <t>The use of a link with the "linkset" relation 
                type does not preclude the provision of links with other relation types, 
                i.e. the resource that is the link context can provide typed links other than a "linkset" link. 
                 <!-- Therefore, the
                effective set of links provided by that resource is the union of the links that the
                resource itself provides, and the links provided by the resource that is the target of the "linkset" link - 
                in which it participates.</t>  -->
            <t>A user agent that follows a "linkset" link MUST be aware that the set of links provided by the resource that is the target of the link 
                can contain links in which the resource that is the context of the link does not participate; it MAY decide to ignore those links.</t>
            <t>A user agent that follows a "linkset" link and obtains links for which anchors and targets are not expressed as 
                absolute URIs MUST properly determine what the context is for these links; it SHOULD ignore links for which it is unable to 
                unambiguously make that determination.</t>
            <!--
            <t>There is no constraint on the target URI of a link with the "linkset" relation type;
                designing and using these URIs is left to the discretion of implementers.</t>          
            <t>In common scenarios (the origin resource is distinct from the 
                link set resource), it is essential for link set representations to 
                make the URI of the origin resource explicit for those links in 
                which the origin resource acts as link context.</t>
                -->
            <!--
             <t>If an origin resource provides a "linkset" link pointing at a link set resource, 
                and that link set resource provides a "linkset" link in turn, 
                then this latter link points at links pertaining to the link set resource. 
                This means that in the context of the latter link, the link set resource is an origin
                resource. This means that linkset relations are not transitive, and it is up to a client
                to decide whether they follow chains of "linkset" links or not.</t>
