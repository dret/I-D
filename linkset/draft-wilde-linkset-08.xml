           <t>This specification defines two document formats and respective media types for representing sets of links as stand-alone resources. One format is JSON-based, the other aligned with the format for representing links in the HTTP "Link" header field. This specification also introduces a link relation type to support discovery of sets of links.</t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
            <t>Resources on the Web often use typed Web Links <xref target="RFC8288"/>, either embedded in resource representations, for example using the &lt;link&gt; element for HTML documents, or conveyed in the HTTP "Link" header for documents of any media type. In some cases, however, providing links in this manner is impractical or impossible and delivering a set of links as a stand-alone document is preferable.</t> 
            <t>Therefore, this specification defines two document formats and associated media types to represent sets of links. It also defines the "linkset" relation type that supports discovery of any resource that conveys a set of links as a stand-alone document.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
            <t>This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link target" as defined in 
                <xref target="RFC8288"/>. 
                These terms respectively correspond with "Context IRI" and "Target IRI" as used in <xref target="RFC5988"/>. Although defined as IRIs, in common scenarios they are also URIs.</t> 
            <t>In the examples provided in this document, links in the HTTP "Link" header are shown on separate lines in order to improve readability. 
                Note, however, that as per Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC7230"/>, line breaks are not allowed in values for HTTP headers; only whitespaces and 
                tabs are supported as seperators.
            </t>
            <!--
            <t>Additionally, this specification uses the following terms for types of resources involved 
                in providing links by reference:</t> 
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>A "linkset resource" is a resource that conveys a set of links. <xref target="linkset-formats"/> 
                   defines two representations for a set of links, based on the abstract link model defined in 
                    <xref target="RFC8288"/>.</t>
                <t>An "origin resource" is a resource that participates in one or more links provided 
                   by a linkset resource. An origin resource can support discovery of an associated 
                   linkset resource by using the relation type defined in <xref target="linkset-link-relation"/>.
                   As such, from the perspective of the origin resource, the links conveyed by the linkset resource 
                   are provided by reference.</t>
            </list></t>
            -->
        </section>
        <section title="Scenarios" anchor="scenarios">
            <t>The following sections outline scenarios in which providing links by means of a standalone document instead of in an HTTP "Link" header field or as links embedded in the resource representation is advantageous or necessary.</t>
            <t>For all scenarios, links could be provided by means of a stand-alone document that is formatted according to the JSON-based serialization, the serialization aligned with the HTTP "Link" header format, or both. The former serialization is motivated by the widespread use of JSON and related tools, which suggests that handling sets of links expressed as JSON documents should be attractive to developers. The latter serialization is provided for compatibility with the existing serialization used in the HTTP "Link" header and to allow reuse of tools created to handle it.</t>
            <t>It is important to keep in mind that when providing links by means of a standalone representation, other links can still be provided using other approaches, i.e. it is possible combine various mechanisms to convey links.</t>
            <section title="Third-Party Links" anchor="third-party">
                <t>In some cases it is useful that links pertaining to a resource are provided 
                    by a server other than the one that hosts the resource. For example, this allows:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t>Providing links in which the resource is involved not just as link context but 
                        also as link target.</t> 
                    <t>Providing links pertaining to the resource that the server hosting that 
                        resource is not aware of.</t>
                    <t>External management of links pertaining to the resource in a special-purpose link
                        management service.</t>
                </list></t>
                <t>In such cases, links pertaining to a resource can be provided by another, specific resource. 
                    That specific resource may be managed by the same or by another custodian as the resource to which the links pertain. 
                    For clients intent on consuming links provided in that manner, it would be beneficial if the following conditions were met:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t>Links are provided in a document that uses a well-defined media type.</t>
                    <t>The resource to which the provided links pertain is able to link to the resource that provides these links using a well-known 
                    link relation type.</t>
                </list></t>
                <t>These requirements are addressed in this specification through the definition of two media types and a link relation type, respectively.</t>
                    <!--
                <t>In order for the server hosting the resource to provide an up-to-date and complete set of links 
                    in which that resource participates, 
                    the server would need to obtain the links from the third-party resource, 
                    and embed them in the resource's 
                    representations prior to responding to a client. Doing so would increase latency and load, 
                    which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on consuming these links. Providing links by means of a standalone document, 
                    removes the server-to-server communication and resulting overhead required to obtain
                    links. Instead, the consumer of the resource can decide if they need the additional links as context
                    for the resource and only access the third-party resource that provides the links if they do.</t>
                    -->
            </section>
            <section title="Challenges Writing to HTTP Link Header Field" anchor="header-writing">
                <t>In some cases, it is not straightforward to write links to the HTTP "Link" header field
                    from an application. This can, for example, be the case because not all 
                    required link information is available to the application or because the 
                    application does not have the capability to directly write HTTP headers. 
                    In such cases, providing links by means of a standalone document can be a solution. 
                    Making the resource that provides these links discoverable can be achieved by means of a 
                    typed link.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Large Number of Links" anchor="link-volume">
                <t>When conveying links in an HTTP "Link" header field, it is possible for the size of the HTTP 
                    response header to become unpredictable. This can be the case when links are determined 
                    dynamically dependent on a range of contextual factors. It is possible to statically configure 
                    a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by specifying an upper bound 
                    for their size. But when the number of links is 
                    unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper bound is challenging.</t>
                <t>HTTP <xref target="RFC7231"/> defines error codes related to excess communication 
                    by the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI Too Long"), but no specific
                    error codes are defined to indicate that response header content exceeds the upper bound that can 
                    be handled by the server, and thus it has been truncated.
                    As a result, applications take counter measures aimed at controlling 
                    the size of the HTTP "Link" header field, for example by limiting the links they provide to those 
                    with select relation types, thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header field to clients. 
                    Providing links by means of a standalone document overcomes challenges related to the unpredictable 
                    nature of the size of HTTP "Link" header fields.</t>
                <!--
                <t>In more extreme scenarios it is conceivable that the number of links to be conveyed becomes so 
                    large that even a standalone document would become too large. 
                    For example, this could be the case for highly interlinked resources and when links are provided in which such 
                    resources participates as both link context and link target.
                    In such cases, the links could be delivered incrementally, for example, by means of a paged resource model.</t>

        <section title="Document Formats for Sets of Links" anchor="linkset-formats">
            <t>This section specifies two document formats to convey a set of links. Both are based on the abstract model  
                specified in Section 2 of Web Linking <xref target="RFC8288"/> 
                that defines a link as consisting of a "link context", a "link relation type", a "link target",

                link sets defined here, inverse links SHOULD be represented as direct links using the "rel" construct and by switching the position of the resources involved 
                in the link.</t>

                        The last extension target attribute ("baz*") follows the naming rule of <xref target="RFC8187"/> and therefore is encoded according to the serialization described in  <xref target="linkset-json-i18n-link-parameter"/>. </t>

                            target attributes, an associated HTTP Link Hint Registry, and a set of attributes to initially populate that registry. 
                            The initial registry, for example, includes the "allow" attribute that can be used to convey the HTTP methods that are supported 
                            to interact with the target resource.</t>

                            <t>A Link Hint target attribute is represented as a member of the link context object with the same name of the attribute as registered in the HTTP Link Hint Registry.</t>

        <section title='The "linkset" Relation Type for Linking to a Set of Links' anchor="linkset-link-relation">
            <t>The target of a link with the "linkset" relation type provides a set of links, 
                including links in which the resource that is the link context participates.</t>
            <t>A link with the "linkset" relation type MAY be provided in the header and/or 
                the body of a resource's representation. It may also be discovered by other means, such as through
                client-side information.</t>
            <t>A resource MAY provide more than one link with a "linkset" relation type. 
                Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed using different 
                media types, or to different sets of links, potentially provided by different third-party services.</t> 
            <!-- <t>The use of a link with the "linkset" relation 
                type does not preclude the provision of links with other relation types, 
                i.e. the resource that is the link context can provide typed links other than a "linkset" link. 
                Therefore, the
                effective set of links provided by that resource is the union of the links that the
                resource itself provides, and the links provided by the resource that is the target of the "linkset" link - 
                in which it participates.</t>  -->
            <t>A user agent that follows a "linkset" link MUST be aware that the set of links provided by the resource that is the target of the link 
                can contain links in which the resource that is the context of the link does not participate; it MAY decide to ignore those links.</t>
            <t>A user agent that follows a "linkset" link and obtains links for which anchors and targets are not expressed as 
                absolute URIs MUST properly determine what the context is for these links; it SHOULD ignore links for which it is unable to 
                unambiguously make that determination.</t>
            <!--
            <t>There is no constraint on the target URI of a link with the "linkset" relation type;
                designing and using these URIs is left to the discretion of implementers.</t>          
            <t>In common scenarios (the origin resource is distinct from the 
                linkset resource), it is essential for linkset representations to 
                make the URI of the origin resource explicit for those links in 
                which the origin resource acts as link context.</t>
                -->
            <!--
             <t>If an origin resource provides a "linkset" link pointing at a linkset resource, 
                and that linkset resource provides a "linkset" link in turn, 
                then this latter link points at links pertaining to the linkset resource. 
                This means that in the context of the latter link, the linkset resource is an origin
                resource. This means that linkset relations are not transitive, and it is up to a client
                to decide whether they follow chains of "linkset" links or not.</t>

            <t>The security considerations of Web Linking <xref target="RFC8288"/> apply, as long as they are not specifically discussing the risks of exposing information in HTTP header fields.</t>
            <t>In general, links may cause information leakage when they expose information (such as URIs) that can be sensitive or private. Links may expose "hidden URIs" that are not supposed to be openly shared, and may not be sufficiently protected. Ideally, none of the URIs exposed in links should be supposed to be "hidden"; instead, if these URIs are supposed to be limited to certain users, then technical measures should be put in place so that accidentally exposing them does not cause any harm.</t>
            <t>For the specific mechanisms defined in this specification, two security considerations should be taken into account:</t>
            <t>
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>The Web Linking model always has an "implicit context", which is the resource of the HTTP interaction. This original context can be lost or can change when self-contained link representations are moved. Changing the context can change the interpretation of links when they have no explicit anchor, or when they use relative URIs. Applications may choose to ignore links that have no explicit anchor or that use relative URIs when these are exchanged in stand-alone resources.</t>
                    <t>The model introduced in this specification supports "3rd party links", where one party can provide links that have another party's resource as an anchor. Depending on the link semantics and the application context, it is important to verify that there is sufficient trust in that 3rd party to allow it to provide these links. Applications may choose to treat 3rd party links differently than cases where a resource and the links for that resource are provided by the same party.</t>
