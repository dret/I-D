      Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets
                         draft-wilde-linkset-01

Abstract

   This specification defines two media types and a link relation type
   for sets of links.  Using these media types and/or link relation is
   useful when it becomes necessary to represent links outside the
   context of a resource that participates in these links.  One typical
   scenario is when the number of links to put in an HTTP Link header
   field becomes too big, and thus these links should be provided by a
   distinct resource.

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


1.  Introduction

   Resources on the Web often convey typed Web Links
   [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis] as a part of resource representations,
   for example, using the <link> element for HTML representations, or
   the "Link" header field in HTTP response headers for representations
   of any media type.  In some cases, however, providing links by value
   is impractical or impossible.  In these cases, an approach to provide
   links by reference (instead of by value) can solve the problem.

   To that end, this specification defines two document formats and
   associated media types to represent a set of links.  It also defines
   the "linkset" relation type that a resource can use to support
   discovery of another resource that conveys links in which the former
   resource participates.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link target" as
   defined in [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].  (These terms respectively
   correspond with "Context IRI" and "Target IRI" as used in RFC 5988
   [RFC5988]).  Although defined as IRIs, in common scenarios they are
   also URIs.

   Additionally, this specification uses the following terms for types
   of resources involved in providing links by reference:

   o  A "link set resource" is a resource that conveys a set of links.
      Section 4 defines two representations for a set of links, based on
      the abstract link model defined in [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].

   o  An "origin resource" is a resource that participates in one or
      more links provided by a link set resource.  An origin resource
      can support discovery of an associated link set resource by using
      the relation type defined in Section 5.  As such, from the
      perspective of the origin resource, the links conveyed by the link
      set resource are provided by reference.

3.  Scenarios

   The following sections outline some scenarios in which it is useful
   to have the ability to separate resources from the links that pertain
   to them.




Wilde & Van de Sompel     Expires March 2, 2018                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


   These are all scenarios in which providing links by reference is
   advantageous or necessary.  It is important to keep in mind that,
   when providing some links by reference, some/other links can still be
   provided by value.

3.1.  Third-Party Links

   In some cases, it is useful that links pertaining to an origin
   resource are provided by a server other than the one that hosts the
   origin resource.  For example, this allows:

   o  Providing links in which the origin resource is involved not just
      as link context but also as link target.

   o  Providing links pertaining to the origin resource that the server
      hosting that resource is not aware of.

   o  External management of links pertaining to the origin resource in
      a special-purpose link management service.

   In such cases, a third-party link set resource provides links
   pertaining to the origin resource.  This link set resource may be
   managed by the same custodian as the origin resource, or by a third
   party.

   In order for the server hosting the origin resource to provide an up-
   to-date and complete set of links in which the origin resource
   participates, the server would need to obtain the links from the link
   set resource, and embed them in the origin resource's representations
   prior to responding to a client.  Doing so would increase latency and
   load, which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on consuming
   these links.  Providing links by reference, instead of by value,
   removes the server-to-server communication and resulting overhead
   required to obtain links.  Instead, the consumer of the origin
   resource can decide if they need the additional links as context for
   the resource.

3.2.  Challenges Writing to HTTP Header Field

   In some cases, it is not straightforward to write links to the HTTP
   Link header from an application.  This can, for example, be the case
   because not all required link information is available to the
   application or because the application does not have the capability
   to directly write HTTP headers.  In such cases, providing links by
   reference can be a solution because a link to a link set resource
   associated with an origin resource can typically be added by means of
   a web server rewrite rule that leverages the resource's URI.

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


3.3.  Large Number of Links

   When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, it is possible for
   the size of the HTTP response header to become unpredictable.  This
   can be the case when links are determined dynamically dependent on a
   range of contextual factors.  It is possible to statically configure
   a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by
   specifying an upper boundary for their size.  But when the number of
   links is unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is
   challenging.

   HTTP [RFC7231] defines error codes related to excess communication by
   the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI
   Too Long"), but no specific error codes are defined to indicate that
   response header content exceeds the upper boundary that can be
   handled by the server, and thus it has been truncated.  As a result,
   applications take counter measures aimed at controlling the size of
   the HTTP "Link" header, for example by limiting the links they
   provide to those with select relation types, thereby limiting the
   value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients.  Providing links by
   reference, instead of by value, overcomes challenges related to the
   unpredictable nature of the extent of HTTP "Link" headers.

   In more extreme scenarios it is conceivable that the number of links
   pertaining to the origin resource becomes so large that the response
   from the associated link set resource becomes too large.  This could
   be the case for highly popular origin resources, when the link set
   includes links in which the origin resource participates as both link
   context and link target.  In such cases, the link set resource could
   deliver responses incrementally, for example, using a paged resource
   model that clients can consume as required.

4.  Document Formats for Link Sets

   Link set resources can be represented by serializations that support
   conveying both link contexts and link targets.  This section
   specifies two document formats based on the abstract model specified
   in Section 2 of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis] that defines a link as
   consisting of a "link context", a "link relation type", a "link
   target", and optional "target attributes".  In those terms, a link
   set resource is a resource that conveys a collection of one or more
   such links.  The format defined in Section 4.1 is identical to the
   payload of the HTTP Link header as specified in
   [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].  The format defined in Section 4.2 is
   based on JSON and thus does not have the character encoding
   limitations of HTTP header fields.

4.1.  HTTP Link Document Format for Link Sets: application/linkset

   This document format is identical to the payload of the HTTP Link
   header.  It is defined in Section 3 of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis],
   more specifically by its ABNF production rule for "Link" and
   subsequent ones.  The assigned media type for this format is
   "application/linkset".

4.2.  JSON Document Format for Link Sets: application/linkset+json

   This document format is based on the native Link header field
   representation defined by [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis], but uses JSON
   [RFC7159] as the syntax to represent the information contained in the
   native format.  It is described in this section.  The assigned media
   type for this format is "application/linkset+json".

4.2.1.  Representing a Link Set

   In the JSON representation of a link set:

   o  A link set MUST be represented as a JSON array.

   o  Each individual link of the link set MUST be represented as a
      distinct JSON object in the array, in the form of a "link object"
      (see Section 4.2.2).

   o  Implementations MUST wrap link objects in an array, even if the
      link set contains only one link.

   o  Implementations MUST NOT include any members other than link
      objects in the array that represents a link set.

4.2.2.  Representing a Link

   In the JSON representation, an individual link is represented by a
   dedicated JSON object, the link object.  A Link object adheres to the
   following rules:

   o  Each link object MUST have an "href" member with a value that
      represents the link target.

   o  Each link object MAY have an "anchor" member with a value that
      represents the link context.  If this member is not provided, the
      link context is the link set resource.

   o  The value of both the "href" and "anchor" members MUST be a URI-
      reference as defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3986].  Note that for

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


      relative references, the baseURI is the URI of the link set
      resource.

   o  Each link object MUST have a "rel" or "rev" member (with the
      latter one deprecated) with a value that represents a set of link
      relation types, represented as an array of strings.  The value of
      each "rel"/"rev" link relation type MUST either be a registered
      relation type or an extension relation type (URI), as described in
      Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis],
      respectively.

   o  Each link object MAY have additional members to convey target
      attributes (see Section 4.2.3).

   The following example of a JSON-serialized link set represents one
   link with the core components of a link: link context, link relation
   type, and link target.

   [ { "href" : "http://example.com/foo",
       "anchor" : "http://example.net/bar",
       "rel" : [ "next" ] } ]

   The following example of a JSON-serialized link set represents two
   links with the core components of a link: link context, link relation
   type, and link target.  The syntax of this example takes advantage of
   the fact that multiple relation types can be used in one link object
   (which effectively turn the link objects into a shortcut representing
   as many links as there are link relation types).

   [ { "href" : "http://example.com/foo",
       "anchor" : "http://example.net/bar",
       "rel" : [ "next" , "http://example.net/linkrel" ] } ]

   The previous example is equivalent to the following one, which does
   not use the syntax shortcut and therefore represents the two links
   individually.

   [ { "href" : "http://example.com/foo",
       "anchor" : "http://example.net/bar",
       "rel" : [ "next" ] },
     { "href" : "http://example.com/foo",
       "anchor" : "http://example.net/bar",
       "rel" : [ "http://example.net/linkrel" ] } ]

4.2.3.  Representing Link Target Attributes

   In many cases, a link is further qualified by target attributes,
   either defined by the serialization of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis] or
   extension attributes defined and used by communities.

4.2.3.1.  JSON Representation of RFC 5988bis Target Attributes

   RFC 5988bis allows link relations to be potentially annotated via the
   "hreflang", "media", "title", "title*", and "type" target attributes.
   These target attributes follow different occurrence and value
   patterns (as discussed in more detail in Section Section 4.2.4), but
   are specifically defined to be handled in the JSON representation as
   follows:

   o  "hreflang": The "hreflang" target attribute can be repeated, and
      thus the JSON representation uses an array to capture occurrences
      of the "hreflang" target attribute.  The hreflang member of a link
      object always MUST be an array (even if there only is one value to
      be represented), and each value in that array MUST be a string,
      representing one occurrence of an "hreflang" target attribute on a
      link.

   o  "media": The optional "media" target attribute is represented by a
      "media" member in the link object, with its value being a single
      string that is following the same model as in the native syntax.

   o  "type": The optional "type" target attribute is represented by a
      "type" member in the link object, with its value being a single
      string that is following the same model as in the native syntax.

   o  "title": The optional "title" target attribute is represented by a
      "title" member in the link object, with its value being a single
      string that is following the same model as in the native syntax.

   o  "title*": This construct is inspired by character encoding and
      language issues and follows the model defined in RFC 5987
      [RFC5987].  The content uses a string-based microsyntax that
      represents character encoding, an optional language tag, and the
      actual title.  The details of the JSON representation are
      described in Section Section 4.2.3.2.

4.2.3.2.  Representing Internationalized Target Attributes for a Link

   In addition to the target attributes described in Section 4.2.3,
   [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis] also supports attributes that follow the
   attribute model of RFC 5987 [RFC5987].  In
   [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis], these target attributes are recognizable



Wilde & Van de Sompel     Expires March 2, 2018                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


   by the use of a trailing asterisk in the attribute name, such as
   "title*".  The JSON serialization for these attributes is different
   than for those of Section 4.2.3.

   Internationalized link parameters use the link parameter name as
   their name, and their value is either a string representing the link
   parameter value, or an object representing one or more language
   tagged link parameter values.  In such an object, the set of members
   uses a language tag [RFC5646] as their names, and their values are
   strings representing the link parameter values associated with the
   respective language tag.

4.2.4.  JSON Representation of Extension Target Attributes

   Extension target attributes are any target attributes that are not
   defined by RFC 5988bis (as listed in Section Section 4.2.3.1), but
   are used to qualify links.  When they occur on links, it is not
   apparent from their usage in link instances how they are defined.
   They can be defined in any way deemed necessary, and it is up to the
   creator of extension target attributes to make sure their usage is
   well-defined.  This is particularly important when it comes to
   repeatable target attributes.

   While the native syntax (as defined in Section Section 4.1 supports
   and allows repeating link parameters, the JSON representation defined
   here does not support, and therefore not allow repeated target
   attributes.  For this reason, every extension target attribute is
   treated as being potentially repeating, and thus represented as a
   JSON array.  Every extension target attribute serialized in the JSON
   syntax MUST be an array.  Each of the values in the array MUST be a
   string, with each string representing one occurrence of the extension
   target attribute.  Specifically, this means that extension target
   attributes that do not repeat on a link still MUST be represented as
   an array, with the attribute value appearing as a string as the
   single member of that array.

   The combined result of that rule and JSON's lacking support for
   repeating members of the same name means that repeating extension
   target attributes MUST be combined into one JSON member that has the
   extension target attribute's name as the member name, and has an
   array as its value which has the values of all the extension target
   attribute occurrences as string values of the array.

5.  The "linkset" Relation Type for Linking to Link Sets

   The target of a link with the "linkset" relation type - the link set
   resource - provides a set of links, including links in which the link
   context - the origin resource - particpates.



Wilde & Van de Sompel     Expires March 2, 2018                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


   A link with the "linkset" relation type MAY be provided in the header
   and/or the body of the origin resource's representation.  It may also
   be discovered by other means, such as through client-side
   information.

   More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided.
   Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed
   using different representations, or to different sets of links
   (potentially provided by different services).

   The use of a link with the "linkset" relation type does not preclude
   the provision of links with other relation types, i.e. the origin
   resource can provide typed links other than a "linkset" link.
   Therefore, the effective set of links pertaining to the origin
   resource is the union of the links that the resource itself provides,
   and of all links - provided by the link set resource - in which it
   participates.

   The link set resource MAY provide the links that pertain to the
   origin resource in its HTTP response header and/or body.

   In common scenarios (the origin resource is distinct from the link
   set resource), it is essential for link set representations to make
   the URI of the origin resource explicit for those links in which the
   origin resource acts as link context.

   A user agent that follows a "linkset" link from an origin resource
   MUST be aware that the link set resource can provide links in which
   the origin resource does not participate and MAY decide to ignore
   those links.

   There is no constraint on the target URI of a link with the "linkset"
   relation type; designing and using these URIs is left to the
   discretion of implementers.

   If an origin resource provides a "linkset" link pointing at a link
   set resource, and that link set resource provides a "linkset" link in
   turn, then this latter link points at links pertaining to the link
   set resource.  This means that in the context of the latter link, the
   link set resource is an origin resource.  This means that linkset
   relations are not transitive, and it is up to a client to decide
   whether they follow "nested chains" of "linkset" links or not.

6.  Examples

   Sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 show examples whereby the link
   set resource provides links pertaining to the origin resource, in its
   response header and body, respectively.

   While in this example the URI of the link set resource uses a pattern
   that represents the URI of the origin resource, this is opaque to the
   client, which simply follows target URI to retrieving the link set
   resource.

   Figure 3 shows the client issuing an HTTP GET request against the
   link set resource provided in Figure 2.

   Note that most, but not all, links have the origin resource as link

            Figure 6: Response to HTTP HEAD on Origin Resource

   In this example, the URI of the linkset resource does not directly
   represent the URI of the origin resource anymore.  There still is an
   association possible through the use of a URI pattern that is
   includes identifying information.  But as in the example above, the
   URI of the link set resource is opaque to the client that simply
   accesses the URI to retrieve the link set resource.

   Figure 7 shows the client issuing an HTTP GET request against the
   link set resource provided in Figure 6.

   GET /links/10.1371/journal.pone.0167475 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   Figure 8 shows the response headers to the HTTP GET request of
   Figure 7.  The links pertaining to the origin resource are provided
   in the response body of the link set resource and are serialized
   according to the media type application/linkset+json.

       Figure 8: Response to HTTP GET against the Link Set Resource

   If Figure 6 would have provided a link to a link set with media type
   application/linkset, and if the client would have requested that link
   set, then the body of the response would have been similar to
   Figure 8.  But it would have had application/linkset as Content-Type,
   the payload of the HTTP Link header of Figure 4 as body, and an
   accordingly adjusted value for Content-Length.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Link Relation Type: linkset

   The link relation type below has been registered by IANA per
   Section 6.2.1 of Web Linking [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis]:

      Relation Name: linkset

      Description: The Target IRI of a link with the "linkset" relation
      type provides a set of links that pertain to the Context IRI of
      the link.
