			<t>This memo updates the text/csv media type defined in RFC 4180 <xref target="RFC4180"/> by defining URI fragment identifiers for text/csv MIME entities.</t>
			<t>The change to the text/csv media type registration required IESG approval, as the IESG is the change controller for that registration. The IESG has, after consultation with the IETF community, approved the change, which is specified in <xref target="IANA"/> of this document.</t>
			<t>This section gives an introduction to the general
concepts of text/&wj;csv MIME entities and URI fragment identifiers and discusses the need for fragment identifiers for text/csv and deployment issues. <xref target="methods"/> discusses the principles and methods on which this memo is based. <xref target="syntax"/> defines the syntax, and <xref target="processing"/> discusses processing of text/csv fragment identifiers.</t>
			<section title="What is text/csv?" anchor="what">
				<t>Internet Media Types (often referred to as
"MIME types") as defined in RFC 2045 <xref target="RFC2045"/> and RFC 2046
<xref target="RFC2046"/> are used to identify different types and subtypes of
media. The text/csv media type is defined in RFC 4180 <xref target="RFC4180"/>,
using US-ASCII <xref target="ASCII"/> as the default character encoding (other
character encodings can be used as well). Apart from a media type parameter for
specifying the character encoding ("charset"), there is a second media type parameter ("header") that indicates whether there is a header row in the CSV document or not.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Why text/csv Fragment Identifiers?" anchor="why">
				<t>URIs are the identification mechanism for
resources on the Web.  The URI syntax specified in RFC 3986 <xref target="RFC3986"/> optionally includes a so-called "fragment identifier", separated by a number sign ("#"). The fragment identifier consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the client after the retrieval action has been successfully completed. The semantics of a fragment identifier is a property of the media type resulting from a retrieval action, regardless of the URI scheme used in the URI reference. Therefore, the format and interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type of the retrieval result.</t>

				<section title="Motivation" anchor="motivation">
					<t>Similar to the motivation in RFC
5147 <xref target="RFC5147"/>, which defines fragment identifiers for plain text
files, referring to specific parts of a resource can be very useful because it
enables users and applications to create more specific references. 

<!-- [rfced] May this sentence be revised for clarity as follows?

ORIGINAL:
   Users can create
   references to the part they really are interested in or want to talk
   about, rather than always pointing to a complete resource.

SUGGESTED:
   Users can create references to a particular point of interest within 
   a resource, rather than referring to the complete resource.
-->

Users can create references to the part they really are interested in or want to talk about, rather than always pointing to a complete resource. Even though it is suggested that fragment identification methods are specified in a media type's registration (see <xref target="RFC6838"/>), many media types do not have fragment identification methods associated with them.</t>
					<t>Fragment identifiers are only useful if supported by the client, because they are only interpreted by the client. Therefore, a new fragment identification method will require some time to be adopted by clients, and older clients will not support it. However, because the URI still works even if the fragment identifier is not supported (the resource is retrieved, but the fragment identifier is not interpreted), rapid adoption is not highly critical to ensure the success of a new fragment identification method.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Use Cases" anchor="usecases">
					<t>Fragment identifiers for text/csv as defined in this memo make it possible to refer to specific parts of a text/csv MIME entity. Use cases include, but are not limited to, selecting a part for visual rendering, stream processing, making assertions about a certain value (provenance, confidence, comments, etc.), or data integration.</t>
			</section>
                       </section>
			<section title="Incremental Deployment" anchor="incremental">
				<t>As long as text/csv fragment identifiers are not supported universally, it is important to consider the implications of incremental deployment. Clients (for example, Web browsers) not supporting the text/csv fragment identifier described in this memo will work with URI references to text/csv MIME entities, but they will fail to understand the identification of the sub-resource specified by the fragment identifier, and thus will behave as if the complete resource was referenced. This is a reasonable fallback behavior and, in general users, should take into account the possibility that a program interpreting a given URI will fail to interpret the fragment identifier part. Since fragment identifier evaluation is local to the client (and happens after retrieving the MIME entity), there is no reliable way for a server to determine whether a requesting client is using a URI containing a fragment identifier.</t>

			<t>This memo specifies fragment identification using
the following methods: "row" for row selections, "col" for columns selections, and "cell" for cell selections.</t>

				<figure>
					<artwork type="uri">http://example.com/data.csv#row=4</artwork>
				</figure>
				<t>The above CSV fragment identifies the fourth row:</t>

				<t>Fragments can also select ranges of rows:</t>

				<t>It is also possible to select cell-based
fragments that have more than just one cell, in which case the cell selection
uses the same range syntax as for row and column range selections. For these
selections, the syntax uses the upper left-hand cell as the starting point of
the selection, followed by a minus sign, and then the lower right-hand cell as the end point of the selection.</t>

				<t>Row, column, and cell selections can make more than one selection, in which case the individual selections are separated by semicolons.

				<t>Rows and columns in CSV are counted from
one. Positions thus refer to the rows and columns starting from position 1, which identifies the first row or column of a CSV.

				<t>If single selections refer to non-existing rows or columns (i.e., beyond the size of the CSV), they MUST be ignored.</t>
				<t>If ranges extend beyond the size of the CSV

<!-- [rfced] May this be rephrased as follows for clarity?

Original:
   If selections of ranges of rows or columns or selections of cell
   ranges are specified in a way so that they select "inversely" (i.e.,
   "#row=10-5" or "#cell=10,10-5,5"), they MUST be ignored.

Perhaps:
   If selections of ranges of rows, ranges of columns, or ranges of
   cells are specified in a way so that they select "inversely" (i.e.,
   "#row=10-5" or "#cell=10,10-5,5"), they MUST be ignored.

Or:
   If selections of row ranges, column ranges, or cell ranges 
   are specified in a way so that they select "inversely" (i.e.,
   "#row=10-5" or "#cell=10,10-5,5"), they MUST be ignored.

				<t>If selections of ranges of rows or columns or selections of cell
   ranges are specified in a way so that they select "inversely" (i.e.,
   "#row=10-5" or "#cell=10,10-5,5"), they MUST be ignored.</t>
				<t>Each specification of an identified region is processed independently, and ignored specifications (because of reasons listed in the previous paragraphs) do not cause the whole fragment identifier to fail, they just mean that this single specification is ignored. For the example file, the fragment identifier "#row=1-2;5-4;13-16" does identify the first two rows: the second specification is an "inverse" specification and thus is ignored, and the third specification targets rows beyond the actual size of the CSV and thus is also ignored.</t>
				<t>The complete fragment identifier identifies
all the successfully evaluated identified parts as a single identified
fragment. This fragment can be disjoint because of multiple
selections. Multiple selections also can result in overlapping individual parts, and it is up to the user agent how to process such a fragment and whether the individual parts are still made accessible (i.e., visualized in visual user agents) or are presented as one unit. For example, the fragment identifier "#row=3-6;4-5" contains a second identified part that is completely contained in the first identified part. Whether a user agent maintains this selection as two parts, or simply signals that the identified fragment spans from the third to the sixth row, is up for the user agent to decide.</t>
