1.  Introduction

   A resource typically conveys typed Web Links [RFC5988] as an inherent
   part of the resource's representation [RFC7231], for example, using
   the <link> element for HTML representations or the "Link" header in
   HTTP response headers for representations of any media type.  Cases
   exist in which providing links in a by value manner is impractical or
   impossible.  In these cases, an approach to provide links by
   reference is desired.  This specification defines the "linkset"
   relation type that allows doing so.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Scenarios

4.1.  Third-Party Links

   Cases exist in which a resource other than the responding resource is
   better placed to provide web links.  That other resource is hosted by
   a link server that may be managed by the same custodian as the
   responding resource or by a third party.  In order for the responding
   server to provide up-to-date links about its resource, it needs to
   obtain them from the link server, and embed them in the resource's
   representation prior to responding to a client.  Doing so increases
   latency, which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on
   consuming links.  Providing links by reference, instead of by value,
   removes this additional latency by avoiding server-to-server
   communication required to obtain links.

4.2.  Large Number of Links

   When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, cases exist in which
   the size of the HTTP response header becomes unpredictable.  This is,
   for example, the case when links are determined dynamically dependent
   on a range of contextual factors.  It is possible to statically
   configure a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response
   headers by specifying an upper boundary for their size.  But, when
   the number of links and the amount of bytes required for each is
   unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is challenging.
   While HTTP RFC 2616 [RFC2616] defines error codes related to excess
   communication by the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and
   "414 Request-URI Too Long"), no error codes are defined to indicate
   that a response header exceeds the upper boundary that can be handled
   by the server.  As a result, applications take counter measures aimed
   at controlling the size of the HTTP "Link" header, for example, by
   limiting the links they provide to those with select relation types,
   thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients.
   Providing links by reference, instead of by value, overcomes
   challenges related to the unpredictable nature of the extent of HTTP
   "Link" headers.

5.  Link Relation for Linking to Link Sets

   The "linkset" relation type can be used by a responding resource to
   refer to another resource that provides a set of links.  Typically
   the Context IRI of these links is the URI of the responding resource
   but links with other Context IRIs MAY be provided.

Internet-Draft         Linkset Link Relation Type          December 2016


   The media type of the link set that is accessible via the Target IRI
   of a link with the "linkset" relation type is not constrained but the
   representation of the link set MUST allow a user-agent to
   unambiguously determine the Context IRI of each provided link.

   More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided.
   Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed
   using different representations or to different link sets.  The use
   of a link with the "linkset" relation type does not preclude the
   provision of links with other relation types.

6.  Examples

   Figure 1 shows a user agent issuing an HTTP head request against
   resource http://example.org/resource1.


   HEAD /resource1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Connection: close


             Figure 1: User Agent Issues HTTP HEAD on Resource

   Sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 exemplify possible responses to
   the HTTP request of Figure 1 that include the provision of a link
   with the "linkset" relation type, as well as a user-agent following
   those links to retrieve a link set.

6.1.  Link Set Serialized As application/link-format

   Figure 2 shows the response to the HEAD request of Figure 1.  The
   response contains a "Link" header with a link that uses the "linkset"
   relation type.  It indicates that links are provided by another
   resource http://example.com/links/http://example.org/resource, which
   has media type application/link-format [RFC6690].  Using this media
   type, links are serialized in the same manner as the payload of the
   "Link" header, which lowers the barrier for user-agents that are
   already able to consume HTTP links.

                Figure 2: Response to HTTP HEAD on Resource

   Figure 3 shows the user agent issuing an HTTP GET request against the
   Target IRI of the link with the "linkset" relation type shown in
   Figure 2.


   GET /links/http://example.org/resource1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/link-format
   Connection: close


   Figure 3: User Agent Issues HTTP GET on application/link-format Link
                               Set Resource

   Figure 4 shows response to the HTTP GET request of Figure 3.  As can
   be seen from this example, in order to support an unambiguous
   determination of the Context IRI of each link, an approach is taken
   whereby:

      The Context IRI is the URI in the "anchor" attribute, when
      provided.

      When no anchor parameter is provided, the Context IRI is provided
      by a unique link in the link set that has the "about" relation
      type and the URI of the link set resource as the value of the
      "anchor" attribute.  The Target IRI of that link is the Context
      IRI of all links in the link set that don't have an "anchor"
      attribute.

6.2.  Link Set Serialized As application/hal+json

   In this example, the response to Figure 1 is the same as Figure 2 but
   the content of the "type" attribute is application/hal+json
   [I-D.kelly-json-hal] instead of application/link-format.  Similarly,
   the user-agent's follow-up request is the same as Figure 3 but using
   application/hal+json in the "Accept" HTTP request header instead of
   application/link-format.  Figure 5 exemplifies a response to that
   follow-up HTTP GET request issued against the link set resource.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The link relation type below has been registered by IANA per
   Section 6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [RFC5988]:

7.1.  Link Relation Type: linkset

      Relation Name: linkset

      Description: The Target IRI of a link with the "linkset" relation
      type provides a set of links.
