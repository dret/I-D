1.  Introduction

   The Hypertext Application Language (HAL) is a simple JSON-based
   document format that combines general-purpose JSON data
   representation with conventions about how to represent links.  It
   defines a separation of links and data, supports embedded resources,
   and also supports a shortcut mechanism so that links that use link
   relations identified by URIs can use a shorthand notation.

   HAL has seen quite a bit of adoption as a general-purpose hypermedia
   format, and that can be in part attributed to its simplicity.
   However, because of this simplicity it allows client-side behavior
   which has implications for the interpretation of link relation
   identifiers.  It allows those identifiers to be interpreted in more
   than one way, which results in clients having a different
   interpretation of the hyperlinks, resulting in differing resource
   semantics based on which of the allowed methods clients implement.

   In scenarios where it is required that clients end up with a
   consistent interpretation of the hyperlinks, such as when for example
   Web Linking [RFC8288] is part of the picture and hyperlinks should be
   consistently identified by either registered relation types (simple
   strings) or extension relation types (URIs), it is possible to define
   and use a subset of HAL that is avoids those mechanisms that
   introduce semantic ambiguity.

   This memo defines a subset of HAL which is technically defined as a
   profile [RFC6906] which can be identified by a media type parameter
   and/or a property in the HAL representation itself.  This subset is
   called WebHAL and is specifically intended to work well in scenarios
   where Web Linking is in use, and where the representation of
   hyperlinks should be free of any ambiguities.

2.  Problem Statement

   HAL is meant as a simple JSON-based way how services and consumers
   can work with simple hypermedia formats, and yet can treat them
   (mostly) as plain JSON.  As one aspect of the general design goal,
   HAL minimizes the constraints it puts on the format.

   The way hypermedia links are represented in HAL is inspired by Web
   Linking [RFC8288], where links are typed, and the link relation type
   is either a simple string, or a URI.  HAL introduces a mechanism that
   is called a "curie" (but is not in fact the CURIE concept as
   standardized in a specification of this name).  Using the "curie"
   mechanism, HAL supports shortcuts of link relations, allowing HAL to
   represent link relations that are in fact URIs in a prefix-based
   notation.  The following example from the HAL specification
   illustrates the mechanism:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": { "href": "/orders" },
       "curies": [{
         "name": "acme",
         "href": "http://docs.acme.com/relations/{rel}",
         "templated": true
       }],
       "acme:widgets": { "href": "/widgets" }
     }
   }

   In this example, the effective link relation is
   "http://docs.acme.com/relations/widgets", with the "acme:widgets"
   link using the shortcut notation for its link relation.

   The problem is that HAL makes resolving these templated link
   relations optional.  This means that based on HAL, it is permissible
   to interpret the link relation as being
   "http://docs.acme.com/relations/widgets" or "acme:widgets".

   As a result, any consumers of this HAL service may interpret the link
   as having the link relation "acme:widgets".  If these consumers now
   store the link or start exposing it in any way, the original identity
   of the link relation ("http://docs.acme.com/relations/widgets") is
   lost.  Not only is the identity lost, it also cannot be restored,
   because the binding to the prefix definition likely will get lost if
   the HAL representation is not preserved or forwarded directly, but
   instead programming logic extracts links and their link relations,
   and then stores those or constructs new representations.

   The bigger effect of this is that link relations as defined by Web
   Linking [RFC8288] are not reliably processed in a landscape of
   service providers and consumers where HAL's "curie" mechanism is
   used.  Link relations can use their identity, which creates
   interoperability problem throughout the landscape.
