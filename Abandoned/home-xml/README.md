# Home Documents for HTTP Services: XML Syntax

This XML syntax is based on the JSON model defined by [draft-nottingham-json-home: "Home Documents for HTTP APIs"](https://github.com/mnot/I-D/tree/gh-pages/http-problem).

If you are using the specification in your implementation, please register it [in this wiki](https://github.com/mnot/I-D/wiki/json-home) (mentioning the fact that your are using the XML representation) so that we can track usage for future development of the draft. Thanks!
