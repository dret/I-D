      Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets
                         draft-wilde-linkset-00

Abstract

   This specification defines two media types and a link relation type
   for sets of links.  Using these media types and/or link relation is
   useful when it becomes necessary to represent links outside the
   context of a resource that participates in these links.  One typical
   scenario is when the number of links to put in an HTTP Link header
   field becomes too big, and thus these links should be provided by a
   distinct resource.

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


1.  Introduction

   Resources on the Web often convey typed Web Links
   [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis] as a part of resource representations,
   for example, using the <link> element for HTML representations, or
   the "Link" header field in HTTP response headers for representations
   of any media type.  In some cases, however, providing links by value
   is impractical or impossible.  In these cases, an approach to provide
   links by reference (instead of by value) can solve the problem.

   To that end, this specification defines two document formats and
   associated media types to convey a set of links.  It also defines the
   "linkset" relation type that a resource can use to support discovery
   of another resource that conveys links in which the former resource
   participates.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link target" as
   defined in [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].  These terms respectively
   correspond with "Context IRI" and "Target IRI" as used in [RFC5988].
   Although defined as IRIs, in common scenarios they are also URIs.

   Additionally, this specification uses the following terms for types
   of resources involved in providing links by reference:

   o  A "link set resource" is a resource that conveys a set of links.
      Section 4 defines two representations for a set of links, based on
      the abstract link model defined in [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].

   o  An "origin resource" is a resource that participates in one or
      more links provided by a link set resource.  An origin resource
      can support discovery of an associated link set resource by using
      the relation type defined in Section 5.  As such, from the
      perspective of the origin resource, the links conveyed by the link
      set resource are provided by reference.

3.  Scenarios

   The following sections outline some scenarios in which it is useful
   to have the ability to separate resources from the links that pertain
   to them.

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


   These are all scenarios in which providing links by reference is
   advantageous or necessary.  It is important to keep in mind that,
   when providing some links by reference, some/other links can still be
   provided by value.

3.1.  Third-Party Links

   In some cases, it is useful that links pertaining to an origin
   resource are provided by a server other than the one that hosts the
   origin resource.  For example, this allows:

   o  Providing links in which the origin resource is involved not just
      as link context but also as link target.

   o  Providing links pertaining to the origin resource that the server
      hosting that resource is not aware of.

   o  External management of links pertaining to the origin resource in
      a special-purpose link management service.

   In such cases, a third-party link set resource provides links
   pertaining to the origin resource.  This link set resource may be
   managed by the same custodian as the origin resource, or by a third
   party.

   In order for the server hosting the origin resource to provide an up-
   to-date and complete set of links in which the origin resource
   participates, the server would need to obtain the links from the link
   set resource, and embed them in the origin resource's representations
   prior to responding to a client.  Doing so would increase latency and
   load, which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on consuming
   these links.  Providing links by reference, instead of by value,
   removes the server-to-server communication and resulting overhead
   required to obtain links.  Instead, the consumer of the origin
   resource can decide if they need the additional links as context for
   the resource.

3.2.  Challenges Writing to HTTP Header Field

   In some cases, it is not straightforward to write links to the HTTP
   Link header from an application.  This can, for example, be the case
   because not all required link information is available to the
   application or because the application does not have the capability
   to directly write HTTP headers.  In such cases, providing links by
   reference can be a solution because a link to a link set resource
   associated with an origin resource can typcially be added by means of
   a web server rewrite rule that leverages the resource's URI.

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


3.3.  Large Number of Links

   When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, it is possible for
   the size of the HTTP response header to become unpredictable.  This
   can be the case when links are determined dynamically dependent on a
   range of contextual factors.  It is possible to statically configure
   a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by
   specifying an upper boundary for their size.  But when the number of
   links is unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is
   challenging.

   HTTP [RFC7231] defines error codes related to excess communication by
   the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI
   Too Long"), but no specific error codes are defined to indicate that
   response header content exceeds the upper boundary that can be
   handled by the server, and thus it has been truncated.  As a result,
   applications take counter measures aimed at controlling the size of
   the HTTP "Link" header, for example by limiting the links they
   provide to those with select relation types, thereby limiting the
   value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients.  Providing links by
   reference, instead of by value, overcomes challenges related to the
   unpredictable nature of the extent of HTTP "Link" headers.

   In more extreme scenarios it is conceivable that the number of links
   pertaining to the origin resource becomes so large that the response
   from the associated link set resource becomes too large.  This could
   be the case for highly popular origin resources, when the link set
   includes links in which the origin resource participates as both link
   context and link target.  In such cases, the link set resource could
   deliver responses incrementally, for example, using a paged resource
   model that clients can consume as required.

4.  Document Formats for Link Sets

   Link set resources can be represented by serializations that support
   conveying both link contexts and link targets.  This section
   specifies two document formats based on the abstract model specified
   in Section 2 of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis] that defines a link as
   consisting of a "link context", a "link relation type", a "link
   target", and optional "target attributes".  In those terms, a link
   set resource is a resource that conveys a collection of one or more
   such links.  The format defined in Section 4.1 is identical to the
   payload of the HTTP Link header as specified in
   [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].  The format defined in Section 4.2 is
   based on JSON and does not have the character encoding limitations to
   which HTTP headers are subject as per [RFC5987].

4.1.  HTTP Link Document Format for Link Sets: application/linkset

   This document format is identical to the payload of the HTTP Link
   header.  It is defined in Section 3 of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis],
   more specifically by its ABNF production rule for "Link" and
   subsequent ones.  The assigned media type for this format is
   "application/linkset".

4.2.  JSON Document Format for Link Sets: application/linkset+json

   This document format is based on JSON [RFC7159].  It is described in
   this section.  The assigned media type for this format is
   "application/linkset+json".

4.2.1.  Representing a Link Set

   In the JSON representation of a link set:

   o  A link set MUST be represented as a JSON array.

   o  Each individual link of the link set MUST be represented as a
      distinct JSON object in the array, named a "link object" (see
      Section 4.2.2).

   Implementations MUST wrap link objects in an array, even if the link
   set contains only one link.

   Implementations MUST NOT include any members other than link objects
   in the array that represents a link set.

4.2.2.  Representing a Link

   In the JSON representation, an individual link is represented by a
   dedicated JSON object, the link object, whereby:

   o  Each link object MUST have an "href" member with a value that
      represents the link target.

   o  Each link object MUST have a "rel" member with a value that
      represents a single link relation type.

   o  Each link object MAY have an "anchor" member with a value that
      represents the link context.  If this member is not provided, the
      link context is the link set resource.

   o  Each link object MAY have additional members to convey target
      attributes (see Section 4.2.3).

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


   o  The value of both the "href" and "anchor" members MUST be a URI-
      reference as defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3986].  Note that for
      relative references, the baseURI is the URI of the link set
      resource.

   o  The value of "rel" MUST either be a registered relation type or an
      extension relation type (URI), as described in Sections 2.1.1 and
      2.1.2 of [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis], respectively.

   [ { "href" : "http://example.com/foo",
       "anchor" : "http://example.net/bar",
       "rel" : "next" } ]

   This example of a JSON-serialized link set contains just one link
   that conveys the core components of a link: link context, link
   relation type, and link target.

4.2.3.  Representing Target Attributes for a Link

   In many cases, a link is further qualified by optional target
   attributes, either defined by the serialization of
   [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis] or extension attributes defined by
   communities.  As per [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis], the following cases
   can occur:

   o  Not repeatable attributes of the "token" variant, e.g. "title"
      defined by [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].

   o  Repeatable attributes of the "token" variant, e.g. "hreflang"
      defined by [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].

   o  Not repeatable attributes of the "token*" variant that use the
      content model of [RFC5987], e.g. "title*" defined by
      [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis].

   o  Repeatable attributes of the "token*" variant that use the content
      model of [RFC5987], e.g. an extension attribute of this type
      defined by a community

4.2.3.1.  Not Repeatable Target Attributes of the "token" Variant

   In the JSON representation, not repeatable attributes of the "token"
   variant are handled as follows:

   o  Each target attribute MUST be serialized as a member of the link
      object that represents the link to which the attribute applies.

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


   o  The name of the target attribute MUST be used as the member name
      and the attribute's value MUST be conveyed as that member's value.

   o  Implementations MUST ignore attributes they do not understand.

   [ { "href" : "http://example.com/foo",
       "anchor" : "http://example.net/bar",
       "rel"  :  "next",
       "type" : "text/html"} ]

   This example adds the "type" target attribute to the link.

4.2.3.2.  Repeatable Target Attributes of the "token" Variant

   In the JSON representation, repeatable attributes of the "token"
   variant are handled as follows:

   o  tbd

   o  Implementations MUST ignore attributes they do not understand.

4.2.3.3.  Not Repeatable Target Attributes of the "token*" Variant

   In the JSON representation, not repeatable attributes of the "token*"
   variant are handled as follows:

   o  tbd

   o  Implementations MUST ignore attributes they do not understand.

4.2.3.4.  Repeatable Target Attributes of the "token*" Variant

   In the JSON representation, repeatable attributes of the "token*"
   variant are handled as follows:

   o  tbd

   o  Implementations MUST ignore attributes they do not understand.

5.  The "linkset" Relation Type for Linking to Link Sets

   The target of a link with the "linkset" relation type - the link set
   resource - provides a set of links, including links in which the link
   context - the origin resource - particpates.

   A link with the "linkset" relation type MAY be provided in the header
   and/or the body of the origin resource's representation.  It may also

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


   be discovered by other means, such as through client-side
   information.

   More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided.
   Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed
   using different representations, or to different sets of links
   (potentially provided by different services).

   The use of a link with the "linkset" relation type does not preclude
   the provision of links with other relation types, i.e. the origin
   resource can provide typed links other than a "linkset" link.
   Therefore, the effective set of links pertaining to the origin
   resource is the union of the links that the resource itself provides,
   and of all links - provided by the link set resource - in which it
   participates.

   The link set resource MAY provide the links that pertain to the
   origin resource in its HTTP response header and/or body.

   In common scenarios (the origin resource is distinct from the link
   set resource), it is essential for link set representations to make
   the URI of the origin resource explicit for those links in which the
   origin resource acts as link context.

   A user agent that follows a "linkset" link from an origin resource
   MUST be aware that the link set resource can provide links in which
   the origin resource does not participate and MAY decide to ignore
   those links.

   There is no constraint on the target URI of a link with the "linkset"
   relation type; designing and using these URIs is left to the
   discretion of implementers.

   If an origin resource provides a "linkset" link pointing at a link
   set resource, and that link set resource provides a "linkset" link in
   turn, then this latter link points at links pertaining to the link
   set resource.  This means that in the context of the latter link, the
   link set resource is an origin resource.  This means that linkset
   relations are not transitive, and it is up to a client to decide
   whether they follow "nested chains" of "linkset" links or not.

6.  Examples

   Sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 show examples whereby the link
   set resource provides links pertaining to the origin resource, in its
   response header and body, respectively.

   resource http://example.org/resource1.

   Figure 2 shows the response to the HEAD request of Figure 1.  The
   response contains a Link header with a link that uses the "linkset"
   relation type.  It indicates that links pertaining to the origin
   resource are provided by link set resource http://example.com/
   links?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fresource.

            Figure 2: Response to HTTP HEAD on Origin Resource

   While in this example the URI of the link set resource uses a pattern
   that represents the URI of the origin resource, this is opaque to the
   client, which simply follows target URI to retrieving the link set
   resource.

   Figure 3 shows the client issuing an HTTP GET request against the
   link set resource provided in Figure 2.

   in the Link response header of the link set resource.  As can be
   seen, in order to support an unambiguous determination of the link
   context of each link, the "anchor" attribute is always provided.

   context (anchor).

Internet-Draft                   Linkset                     August 2017


   Figure 6 shows the response to the HEAD request of Figure 5.  The
   response contains a Link header with a link that has the "linkset"
   relation type.  It indicates that links pertaining to the origin
   resource are provided by link set resource
   http://example.com/links/10.1371/journal.pone.0167475, which provides
   a representation with media type application/linkset+json.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Date: Mon, 28 Nov 2016 14:37:51 GMT
   Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
   Link: <http://example.com/links/10.1371/journal.pone.0167475>
         ; rel="linkset"
         ; type="application/linkset+json"
   Content-Length: 236
   Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
   Connection: close


            Figure 6: Response to HTTP HEAD on Origin Resource

   In this example, the URI of the linkset resource does not directly
   represent the URI of the origin resource anymore.  There still is an
   association possible through the use of a URI pattern that is
   includes identifying information.  But as in the example above, the
   URI of the link set resource is opaque to the client that simply
   accesses the URI to retrieve the link set resource.

   Figure 7 shows the client issuing an HTTP GET request against the
   link set resource provided in Figure 6.

   GET /links/10.1371/journal.pone.0167475 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/linkset+json
   Connection: close

          Figure 7: Client HTTP GET against the Link Set Resource

   Figure 8 shows the response headers to the HTTP GET request of
   Figure 7.  The links pertaining to the origin resource are provided
   in the response body of the link set resource and are serialized
   according to the media type application/linkset+json.

       Figure 8: Response to HTTP GET against the Link Set Resource

   If Figure 6 would have provided a link to a link set with media type
   application/linkset, and if the client would have requested that link
   set, then the body of the response would have been similar to
   Figure 8.  But it would have had application/linkset as Content-Type,
   the payload of the HTTP Link header of Figure 4 as body, and an
   accordingly adjusted value for Content-Length.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Link Relation Type: linkset

   The link relation type below has been registered by IANA per
   Section 6.2.1 of Web Linking [I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis]:

      Relation Name: linkset

      Description: The Target IRI of a link with the "linkset" relation
      type provides a set of links that pertain to the Context IRI of
      the link.
