        <abstract>
            <t>This specification defines two media types and a link relation type for sets of links. 
                Using these media types and/or link relation is useful when 
                it becomes necessary to represent links outside the context of a resource 
                that participates in these links. One typical scenario is when the number of links to put in 
                an HTTP Link header field becomes too big, and thus these links should be provided by a distinct 
                resource.</t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
            <t>Resources on the Web often convey typed Web Links <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis"/> 
               as a  part of resource representations, for example, using the &lt;link&gt; 
               element for HTML representations, or the "Link" header field in HTTP response 
               headers for representations of any media type. In some cases, however, 
               providing links by value is impractical or impossible. 
               In these cases, an approach to provide links by reference (instead of by value) 
               can solve the problem.</t> 
            <t>To that end, this specification defines two document formats and associated media types 
               to convey a set of links. It also defines the "linkset" relation type that a 
               resource can use to support discovery of another resource that conveys 
               links in which the former resource participates.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
            <t>This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link target" as defined in 
                <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis"/>. 
                These terms respectively correspond with "Context IRI" and "Target IRI" as used in 
                <xref target="RFC5988"/>. Although defined as IRIs, in common scenarios they are also URIs.</t> 
            <t>Additionally, this specification uses the following terms for types of resources involved 
                in providing links by reference:</t> 
            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>A "link set resource" is a resource that conveys a set of links. <xref target="linkset-formats"/> 
                   defines two representations for a set of links, based on the abstract link model defined in 
                    <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis"/>.</t>
                <t>An "origin resource" is a resource that participates in one or more links provided 
                   by a link set resource. An origin resource can support discovery of an associated 
                   link set resource by using the relation type defined in <xref target="linkset-link-relation"/>.
                   As such, from the perspective of the origin resource, the links conveyed by the link set resource 
                   are provided by reference.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>
        <section title="Scenarios" anchor="scenarios">
            <t>The following sections outline some scenarios in which it is useful to have the ability to
                separate resources from the links that pertain to them.</t>
            <t>These are all scenarios in which providing links by reference is advantageous or necessary. 
                It is important to keep in mind that, when providing some links by reference, 
                some/other links can still be provided by value.</t>
            <section title="Third-Party Links" anchor="third-party">
                <t>In some cases, it is useful that links pertaining to an origin resource are provided 
                    by a server other than the one that hosts the origin resource. For example, this allows:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                    <t>Providing links in which the origin resource is involved not just as link context but 
                        also as link target.</t> 
                    <t>Providing links pertaining to the origin resource that the server hosting that 
                        resource is not aware of.</t>
                    <t>External management of links pertaining to the origin resource in a special-purpose link
                        management service.</t>
                </list></t>
                <t>In such cases, a third-party link set resource provides links pertaining to the origin resource. 
                    This link set resource may be managed by the same custodian as the origin resource, or by a third party.</t>
                <t>In order for the server hosting the origin resource to provide an up-to-date and complete set of links 
                    in which the origin resource participates, 
                    the server would need to obtain the links from the link set resource, 
                    and embed them in the origin resource's 
                    representations prior to responding to a client. Doing so would increase latency and load, 
                    which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on consuming these links. Providing links by reference, 
                    instead of by value, removes the server-to-server communication and resulting overhead required to obtain
                    links. Instead, the consumer of the origin resource can decide if they need the additional links as context
                    for the resource.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Challenges Writing to HTTP Header Field" anchor="header-writing">
                <t>In some cases, it is not straightforward to write links to the HTTP Link header 
                    from an application. This can, for example, be the case because not all 
                    required link information is available to the application or because the 
                    application does not have the capability to directly write HTTP headers. 
                    In such cases, providing links by reference can be a solution because 
                    a link to a link set resource associated with an origin resource 
                    can typcially be added by means 
                    of a web server rewrite rule that leverages the resource's URI.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Large Number of Links" anchor="link-volume">
                <t>When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, it is possible for the size of the HTTP 
                    response header to become unpredictable. This can be the case when links are determined 
                    dynamically dependent on a range of contextual factors. It is possible to statically configure 
                    a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by specifying an upper boundary 
                    for their size. But when the number of links is 
                    unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is challenging.</t>
                <t>HTTP <xref target="RFC7231"/> defines error codes related to excess communication 
                    by the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and "414 Request-URI Too Long"), but no specific
                    error codes are defined to indicate that response header content exceeds the upper boundary that can 
                    be handled by the server, and thus it has been truncated.
                    As a result, applications take counter measures aimed at controlling 
                    the size of the HTTP "Link" header, for example by limiting the links they provide to those 
                    with select relation types, thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients. 
                    Providing links by reference, instead of by value, overcomes challenges related to the unpredictable 
                    nature of the extent of HTTP "Link" headers.</t>
                <t>In more extreme scenarios it is conceivable that the number of links pertaining to the 
                    origin resource becomes so large that the response from the associated link set resource becomes too large. 
                    This could be the case for highly popular origin resources, when the link set includes 
                    links in which the origin resource participates as both link context and link target.
                    In such cases, the link set resource 
                    could deliver responses incrementally, for example, using a paged resource model that clients 
                    can consume as required.</t>

        <section title="Document Formats for Link Sets" anchor="linkset-formats">
            <t>Link set resources can be represented by serializations that support 
                conveying both link contexts and link targets. 
                This section specifies two document formats based on the abstract model  
                specified in Section 2 of <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis"/> 
                that defines a link as consisting of a "link context", a "link relation type", a "link target", 
                and optional "target attributes". In those terms, a link set resource 
                is a resource that conveys a collection of one or more such links.
                The format defined in <xref target="linkset-native"/> is identical to the payload 
                of the HTTP Link header as specified in <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis"/>. 
                The format defined in <xref target="linkset-json"/> is based on JSON and 
                does not have the character encoding limitations to which HTTP headers 
                are subject as per <xref target="RFC5987"/>.</t>

                <t>This document format is identical to the payload of the

                    <xref target="I-D.nottingham-rfc5988bis"/>, more specifically by  
                    its ABNF production rule for &quot;Link&quot; and subsequent ones.

        <section title="The &quot;linkset&quot; Relation Type for Linking to Link Sets" anchor="linkset-link-relation">
            <t>The target of a link with the "linkset" relation type - the link set resource - provides a set of links, 
                including links in which the link context - the origin resource - particpates.</t>
            <t>A link with the "linkset" relation type MAY be provided in the header and/or 
                the body of the origin resource's representation. It may also be discovered by other means, such as through
                client-side information.</t>
            <t>More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided. 
                Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed using different 
                representations, or to different sets of links (potentially provided by different services).</t> 
             <t>The use of a link with the "linkset" relation 
                type does not preclude the provision of links with other relation types, 
                i.e. the origin resource can provide typed links other than a "linkset" link. Therefore, the
                effective set of links pertaining to the origin resource is the union of the links that the
                resource itself provides, and of all links - provided by the link set resource - 
                in which it participates.</t>
            <t>The link set resource MAY provide the links that pertain to the origin resource 
                 in its HTTP response header and/or body.</t> 
            <t>In common scenarios (the origin resource is distinct from the 
                link set resource), it is essential for link set representations to 
                make the URI of the origin resource explicit for those links in 
                which the origin resource acts as link context.</t>
            <t>A user agent that follows a "linkset" link from an origin resource 
                MUST be aware that the link set resource can provide links in which the 
                origin resource does not participate and MAY decide to ignore those links.</t>
            <t>There is no constraint on the target URI of a link with the "linkset" relation type;
                designing and using these URIs is left to the discretion of implementers.</t>
             <t>If an origin resource provides a "linkset" link pointing at a link set resource, 
                and that link set resource provides a "linkset" link in turn, 
                then this latter link points at links pertaining to the link set resource. 
                This means that in the context of the latter link, the link set resource is an origin
                resource. This means that linkset relations are not transitive, and it is up to a client
                to decide whether they follow "nested chains" of "linkset" links or not.</t>
