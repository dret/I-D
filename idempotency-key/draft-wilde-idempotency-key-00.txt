2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a response header field for the Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that has been registered with the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) following the "Registration
   Procedures for Message Header Fields" [RFC3864].

4.1.  The Idempotency-Key Request Header

   The Idempotency-Key request header should be added to the permanent
   registry of message header fields (see [RFC3864]), taking into
   account the guidelines given by HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231].

   Header Field Name: Idempotency-Key

   Applicable Protocol: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

6.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982
   [RFC6982].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

      Stripe API: The Stripe API uses Idempotency-Key as an HTTP Header
      Field, described at <https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency>

      GoCardless Pro API: The GoCardless Pro API uses Idempotency-Key as
      an HTTP Header Field, described at <https://gocardless.com/blog/
