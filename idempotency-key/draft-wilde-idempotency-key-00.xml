         <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

      <section title="Implementation Status" anchor="implementation-status">
         <t>Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.</t>
         <t>This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982 <xref target="RFC6982"/>. The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>
         <t>According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".</t>
         <t>
            <!-- 
RFC 6982: This section, if it appears, should be located just before the "Security Considerations" section and contain, for each existing implementation, some or all of the following:
 -  The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.
 -  The implementation's name and/or a link to a web page describing the implementation.
 -  A brief general description.
 -  The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype, alpha, beta, production, widely used, etc.
 -  Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are implemented and which versions of the Internet-Draft were implemented.
 -  Licensing: the terms under which the implementation can be used. For example: proprietary, royalty licensing, freely distributable with acknowledgement (BSD style), freely distributable with requirement to redistribute source (General Public License (GPL) style), and other (specify).
 -  Implementation experience: any useful information the implementers want to share with the community.
 -  Contact information: ideally a person's name and email address, but possibly just a URL or mailing list.

               <abstract>
                  <t>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations by including an Implementation Status section. This will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. The process in this document is offered as an experiment. Authors of Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for their documents, and working groups are invited to think about applying the process to all of their protocol specifications. The authors of this document intend to collate experiences with this experiment and to report them to the community.</t>
