                  Link Relation Types for Web Services
                    draft-wilde-service-link-rel-01

Abstract

   Many resources provided on the Web are part of a sets of resources
   that are provided in a context that is defined and managed by one
   particular service provider.  Often, these sets of resources are
   referred to as "Web Services" or "Web APIs".  This specification
   defines two link relations that allow to represent relationships from
   those resources to ones that provide documentation or descriptions of
   the Web services.  The difference between these concepts is that
   documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas
   descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers.

1.  Introduction

   One of the defining aspects of the Web is that it is possible to
   interact with Web resources without any prior knowledge of the
   specifics of the resource.  Following [3], by using URIs, HTTP, and
   media types, the Web's uniform interface allows interactions with
   resources without the more complex binding procedures of other
   approaches.

   However, many resources on the Web are provided as part of a set of
   resources that are referred to as a "Web Service" or a "Web API".  In

   many cases, these services or APIs are defined and managed as a
   whole, and it may be desirable for clients to be able to discover
   this service definition information.

   Service definition can be broadly separated into two categories: One
   category is primarily targeted for human users and often uses generic
   formats for human readable documents, such as HTML or PDF.  The other
   category is structured information that followed some more formalized
   description model, and is primarily intended for consumption by
   machines, for example for tools and code libraries.

   In the context of this specification, the human-oriented variant is
   referred to as "documentation", and the machine-oriented variant is
   referred to as "description".

   These two categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as there
   are formats that have been proposed that are intended for both human
   consumption, and for interpretation by machine clients.

   This specification places no constraints on the specific formats used
   for either of those two categories.  It simply allows publishers of a
   Web service to make the documentation and/or the description of their
   services discoverable, and defines two link relations that serve that
   purpose.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3.  Web Services

   "Web Services" or "Web APIs" (sometimes also referred to as "HTTP
   API" or "REST API") are a way to expose information and services on
   the Web. Following the principles of Web architecture [3], they
   expose URI-identified resources, which are then accessed and
   transferred using a specific representation.  Many services use
   representations that contain links, and often these links are typed
   links.

   Using typed links, resources can identify relationship types to other
   resources.  RFC 5988 [2] establishes a framework of well-known
   registered link relation types, which are identified by simple
   strings and registered in an IANA registry.  Any resource that
   supports typed links according to RFC 5988 can then use these
   identifiers to represent resource relationships on the Web without
   having to re-invent registered relation types.

   In recent years, Web services as well as their documentation and
   description languages have gained popularity, due to the general
   popularity of the Web as a platform for providing information and
   services.  However, the design of documentation and description
   languages varies with a number of factors, such as the general
   application domain, the preferred application data model, and the
   preferred approach for exposing services.

   This specification allows service providers to use a unified way to
   link to service documentation and/or description.  This link should
   not make any assumptions about the provided type of documentation
   and/or description, so that service providers can choose the ones
   that best fit their services and needs.

3.1.  Documenting Web Services

   In the context of this specification, "documentation" refers to
   information that is primarily intended for human consumption.
   Typical formats for this kind of documentation are HTML and PDF.

   Documentation is often structured, but the exact kind of structure
   depends on the structure of the service that is documented, as well
   as on the specific way in which the documentation authors choose to
   document it.

3.2.  Describing Web Services

   In the context of this specification, "description" refers to
   information that is primarily intended for machine consumption.
   Typical formats for this are dictated by the technology underlying
   the service itself, which means that in today's technology landscape,
   description formats exist that are based on XML, JSON, RDF, and a
   variety of other structured data models.  Also, in each of those
   technologies, there may be a variety of languages that are defined to
   achieve the same general purpose of describing a Web service.

   Descriptions are always structured, but the structuring principles
   depend on the nature of the described service.  For example, one of
   the earlier service description approaches, the Web Services
   Description Language (WSDL), uses "operations" as its core concept,
   which are essentially identical to function calls, because the
   underlying model is based on that of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
   model.  Other description languages for non-RPC approaches to
   services will use different structuring approaches.

4.  Link Relations for Web Services

   In order to allow Web services to represent the relation of
   individual resources to service documentation or description, this
   specification introduces and registers two new link relation types.

4.1.  The service-doc Link Relation Type

   The service-doc link relation type is used to represent the fact that
   a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are documented
   at a specific URI.  The target resource is expected to provide
   documentation that is primarily intended for human consumption.

4.2.  The service-desc Link Relation Type

   The service-desc link relation type is used to represent the fact
   that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are
   described at a specific URI.  The target resource is expected to
   provide a service description that is primarily intended for machine
   consumption.  Very often, it is provided in a format that is consumed
   by tools, code libraries, or similar components.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The link relation types below have been registered by IANA per
   Section 6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [2]:

5.1.  Link Relation Type: service-doc

      Relation Name: service-doc

      Description: Linking to service documentation that is primarily
      intended for human consumption.

      Reference: [[ This document ]]

5.2.  Link Relation Type: service-desc

      Relation Name: service-desc

      Description: Linking to service description that is primarily
      intended for consumption by machines.

      Reference: [[ This document ]]
