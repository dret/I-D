      <t>The specification for HTTP API Home Documents provides a JSON syntax only. This specification provides an XML syntax for the same data model, so that the concept of Home Documents can be consistently exposed in both JSON- and XML-based HTTP APIs. It also defines the link relation type "home" so that applications can identify links to home documents.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>"Home Documents for HTTP APIs" <xref target="I-D.nottingham-json-home"/> proposes the concept of "Home Documents" and describes them as follows:</t>
      <t>"This document proposes a 'home document' format for non-browser HTTP clients. [...] The goal of home documents is to serve as a starting point for hypermedia APIs, where clients need to have an entry point, and then can use the API by following links. Home documents thus serve the same purpose as home pages on web sites: They are stable entry points that provide starting points for clients with some knowledge of the services linked from them."</t>
      <t>While this general concept of a home document is independent of the representation format, the specification only defines a JSON syntax. In order to make this concept available across representations, this specification defines an XML syntax for the concepts defined in <xref target="I-D.nottingham-json-home"/>.</t>
      <t>One notable difference is the handling of links found in "href" or "href-template" attributes of "resource" elements: In the JSON syntax, these are (if they are relative URIs) resolved against the URI of the home document itself. The XML syntax adds support for an optional "xml:base" attribute <xref target="W3C.REC-xmlbase-20090128"/> on the "resources" document element. If this attribute is present, it has to be used according to its specification, and thus becomes part of a possible resolution chain of relative URIs.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="XML Example" anchor="xml-example">
      <t>The following Home Document in XML syntax uses the same data as the Home Document shown in <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-04#section-2">Section 2</eref> of <xref target="I-D.nottingham-json-home"/> (but adding xml:base="http://example.com" to demonstrate the mechanism):</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork type="xml"><xi:include parse="text" href="&files;/home-xml.xml"/></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>The mapping between JSON arrays and XML uses "item" elements &lt;i/>, where each of those elements represents one array item. For properties that have a single values (i.e., they are not defined as an array of values), this value is directly contained as content in the corresponding element.</t>
      <t>Currently, the draft does not specify an extension model (how to represents hints that are not specified in the draft itself), and therefore the extension model for XML is currently undefined as well. The XML syntax will be updated to reflect the extension model once it has been specified for the JSON syntax.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="XML Schema" anchor="xml-schema">
      <t>The following XML Schema is describing the XML shown in <xref target="xml-example"/>. Since there currently is no extension model, the XML Schema does currently not contain any extension points.</t>

      <t>Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.</t>
      <t>This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982 <xref target="RFC6982"/>. The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>
      <t>According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".</t>
      <t>
        <!-- 
RFC 6982: This section, if it appears, should be located just before the "Security Considerations" section and contain, for each existing implementation, some or all of the following:
 -  The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.
 -  The implementation's name and/or a link to a web page describing the implementation.
 -  A brief general description.
 -  The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype, alpha, beta, production, widely used, etc.
 -  Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are implemented and which versions of the Internet-Draft were implemented.
 -  Licensing: the terms under which the implementation can be used. For example: proprietary, royalty licensing, freely distributable with acknowledgement (BSD style), freely distributable with requirement to redistribute source (General Public License (GPL) style), and other (specify).
 -  Implementation experience: any useful information the implementers want to share with the community.
 -  Contact information: ideally a person's name and email address, but possibly just a URL or mailing list.
