                 A Media Type for XML Patch Operations
                        draft-wilde-xml-patch-03

Abstract

   The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" defines an XML
   document structure for expressing a sequence of patch operations that
   are applied to an XML document.  The XML Patch document format's
   foundations are defined in RFC 5261, this specification defines a
   document format and a media type registration, so that XML Patch
   documents can be labeled with a media type, for example in HTTP
   conversations.

Internet-Draft                  XML Patch                  February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) [1] is a common format for the
   exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [6] extends HTTP
   [7] with a method to perform partial modifications to resources.
   HTTP PATCH requires that patch documents are being sent along with
   the request, and it is therefore useful if there are standardized
   patch document formats (identified by media types) for popular media
   types.

   The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" is an XML
   document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply
   to a target XML document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH
   method.  Servers can freely choose which patch formats they want to
   accept, and "application/xml-patch+xml" could be a simple default
   format that can be used unless a server decides to use a different
   (maybe more sophisticated) patch format for XML.

   The format for patch documents is based on the XML Patch Framework
   defined in RFC 5261 [2].  While RFC 5261 does define a concrete
   syntax as well as the media type "application/patch-ops-error+xml"
   for error documents, it only defines XML Schema (XSD) [8] types for
   patch operations, and thus the concrete document format and the media
   type for patch operations are defined in an XSD defined in this
   specification.


2.  Patch Document Format

   The XML patch document format is based on a simple schema that uses a
   "patch" element as the document element, and allows an arbitrary
   sequence of "add", "remove", and "replace" elements as the children
   of the document element.  These children follow the semantics defined
   in RFC 5261, which means that each element is treated as an
   individual patch operation, and the result of each patch operation is
   a patched XML document that is the target XML document for the next
   patch operation.

   The following example patch document uses the example from RFC 5261,
   and simply uses a "patch" element and a new XML namespace.  It shows
   the general structure of an XML patch document, as well as an example
   for each operation.

Internet-Draft                  XML Patch                  February 2013


<p:patch xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xxx" xmlns:y="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yyy"
    xmlns:p="urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX patch-document-00.xsd">
    <p:add sel="doc/elem[@a='foo']">
        <!-- This is a new child -->
        <child id="ert4773">
            <y:node/>
        </child>
    </p:add>
    <p:replace sel="doc/note/text()">Patched doc</p:replace>
    <p:remove sel="*/elem[@a='bar']/y:child" ws="both"/>
    <p:add sel="*/elem[@a='bar']" type="@b">new attr</p:add>
</p:patch>

   As this example demonstrates, both the document element "patch" and
   the patch operation elements are in the same XML namespace.  This is
   the result of RFC 5261 only defining types for the patch operation
   elements, which then can be reused in schemas to define concrete
   patch elements.

   RFC 5261 defines an XML Schema (XSD) [8] for the patch operation
   types, which is included for reference in Appendix A.  The normative
   version of this schema is the one given in RFC 5261.  The following
   schema for the XML Patch media type is based on the types defined in
   RFC 5261, which are imported as "rfc5261.xsd" in the following
   schema.  The schema defines a "patch" document element, and then
   allows an unlimited (and possibly empty) sequence of the "add",
   "remove", and "replace" operation elements, which are directly based
   on the respective types from the schema defined in RFC 5261.
<xs:schema targetNamespace="urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX"
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" elementFormDefault="qualified">
    <xs:import schemaLocation="rfc5261.xsd"/>
    <xs:element name="patch">
        <xs:complexType>
            <xs:choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
                <xs:element name="add" type="add"/>
                <xs:element name="remove" type="remove"/>
                <xs:element name="replace" type="replace"/>
            </xs:choice>
        </xs:complexType>
    </xs:element>
</xs:schema>

   concrete XML patch document examples.  Most importantly, the examples
   in RFC 5261 can be taken literally as examples for the XML Patch
   media type, as long as it is assumed that the XML namespace for the
   operation elements in these examples is the URI "urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX".

5.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   As explained in a draft currently under development
   <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sheffer-running-code>, this section
   contains information about implementation status, so that reviews of
   the draft document can take implementation reports into account as
   well.  If you are implementing this draft, please contact this
   draft's author.  Any implementation status reports are intended for
   draft publications only; the section will be removed when the draft
   is published in RFC form.

      EMC: We have implemented the selector part of the spec, which is
      the trickiest part (see Section 7.1 for an explanation).  By
      reusing an existing XPath 1.0 implementation and changing it to
      match the changed default namespace processing model, the required
      behavior is fairly easy to implement.  This does, however, require
      that the implementation is available in source code, and also does
      require some changes to the implementation's code.  The resulting
      implementation is closed source and will be made available, if
      released, as part of EMC's XML database product xDB
      <http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software2/documentum-xdb.htm>.


6.  Security Considerations

   Parsing XML may entail including information from external sources
   through XML's mechanism of external entities.  Implementations
   therefore should be aware of the fact that standard parsers may
   resolve external entities, and thus include external information as a
   result of applying patch operations to an XML document.


7.  Implementation Hints

   This section is informative.  It described some issues that might be
   interesting for implementers, but it might also be interesting for
   users of XML Patch that want to understand some of the differences
   between standard XPath 1.0 processing, and the processing model of
   selectors in RFC 5261.

7.1.  Matching Namespaces

   RFC 5261 defines standard rules for matching prefixed names in
   expressions: Any prefixes are interpreted according to the namespace
   bindings of the diff document (the document that the expression is
   applied against).  This means that each prefixed name can be
   interpreted in the context of the diff document.

   For unprefixed names in expressions, the rules depart from XPath 1.0
   [9].  XPath 1.0 defines that unprefixed names in expressions match
   namespace-less names (i.e., there is no "default namespace" for names
   used in XPath 1.0 expressions).  RFC 5261 requires, however, that
   unprefixed names in expressions must use the default namespace of the
   diff document (if there is one).  This means that it is not possible
   to simply take a selector from a patch document and evaluate it in
   the context of the diff document according to the rules of XPath 1.0,
   because this would interpret unprefixed names incorrectly.  As a
   consequence, it is not possible to simply take an XPath 1.0 processor
   and evaluate XMPL Patch selectors in the context of the diff
   document.

   As an extension of XPath 1.0's simple model, XPath 2.0 [10] specifies
   different processing rules for unprefixed names: They are matched
   against the URI of the "default element/type namespace", which is
   defined as part of an expression's static context.  In some XPath 2.0
   applications, this can be set; XSLT 2.0 for example has the ability
   to define an "xpath-default-namespace", which then will be used to
   match unprefixed names in expressions.  Thus, by using an XPath 2.0
   implementation that allows to set this URI, and setting it to the
   default namespace of the diff document (or leaving it undefined if
   there is no such default namespace), it is possible to use an out-of-
   the-box XPath 2.0 implementation for evaluating XML Patch selectors.

   Please keep in mind, however, that evaluating selectors is only one
   part of applying patches.  When it comes to applying the actual patch
   operation, neither XPath 1.0 nor XPath 2.0 are sufficient, because
   they are not preserving some of the information from the XML syntax
   (specifically: namespace declarations) that is required to correctly
   apply patch operations.  The following section described this issue
   in more detail.

   [[[ Currently, RFC 5261's section on namespace matching explains
   XPath 2.0's rules incorrectly
   <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261#section-4.2.2>.  An erratum has
   been filed
   <http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=5261&eid=3477>
   which, upon verification, will be linked to from here. ]]]

7.2.  Patching Namespaces

   One of the issues when patching namespaces based on XPath is that
   XPath exposes namespaces different than the XML 1.0 [11] syntax for
   XML Namespaces [12].  In the XML syntax, a namespace is declared with
   an attribute using the reserved name or prefix "xmlns", and this
   results in this namespace being available recursively through the
   document tree.  In XPath, the namespace declaration is not exposed as
   an attribute (i.e., the attribute, although syntactically an XML
   attribute, is not accessible in XPath), but the resulting namespace
   nodes are exposed recursively through the tree.

   RFC 5261 uses the terms "namespace declaration" and "namespace"
   almost interchangeably, but it is important to keep in mind that the
   namespace declaration is an XML syntax construct that is unavailable
   in XPath, while the namespace itself is a logical construct that is
   not visible in the XML syntax, but a result of a namespace
   declaration.  The intent of RFC 5261 is to patch namespaces as if
   namespace declarations were patched, and thus it only allows to patch
   namespace nodes on the element nodes where the namespace has been
   declared.

   Patching namespaces in XML Patch is supposed to "emulate" the effect
   of actually changing the namespace declaration (which is why a
   namespace can only be patched at the element where it has been
   declared).  Therefore, when patching a namespace, even though XPath's
   "namespace" axis is used, implementations have to make sure that not
   only the single selected namespace node is being patched, but that
   all namespaces nodes resulting from the namespace declaration of this
   namespace are also patched accordingly.

   This means that an implementation might have to descend into the
   tree, matching all namespace nodes with the selected prefix/URI pair
   recursively, until it encounters leaf elements or namespace
   declarations with the same prefix it is patching.  Determining this
   requires access to the diff document beyond XPath, because in XPath
   itself namespace declarations are not represented, and thus such a
   recursive algorithm wouldn't know when to stop.  Consider the
   following document:
   <x xmlns:a="tag:42">
       <y xmlns:a="tag:42"/>
   </x>

   If this document is patched with a selector of /x/namespace::a, then
   only the namespace node on element x should be patched, even though
   the namespace node on element y has the same prefix/URI combination
   than the one on element x.  However, determining that the repeated
   namespace declaration was present at all on element y is impossible

Internet-Draft                  XML Patch                  February 2013


   when using XPath alone, which means that implementations must have an
   alternative way to determine the difference between the document
   above, and this one:
   <x xmlns:a="tag:42">
       <y/>
   </x>

   In this second example, patching with a selector of /x/namespace::a
   should indeed change the namespace nodes on elements x and y, because
   they both have been derived from the same namespace declaration.

   The conclusion of these considerations is that for implementing XML
   Patch, access closer to the XML syntax (specifically: access to
   namespace declarations) is necessary.  As a result, implementations
   attempting to exclusively use the XPath model for implementing XML
   Patch will fail to correctly address certain edge cases (such as the
   one shown above).

   Note that XPath's specific limitations do not mean that it is
   impossible to use XML technologies other than XPath.  The Document
   Object Model (DOM) [13], for example, does expose namespace
   declaration attributes as regular attributes in the document tree,
   and thus could be used to differentiate between the two variants
   shown above.

   [[[ Currently, RFC 5261's section on replacing namespaces mixes the
   terms "namespace declaration" and "namespace"
   <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261#section-4.4.3>.  An erratum has
   been filed <http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?eid=3478>
   which, upon verification, will be linked to from here. ]]]

Appendix A.  XSD from RFC 5261

   For reference, this section contains a copy of the XML Schema (XSD)
   [8] defining the add, replace, and remove types in RFC 5261 [2].
   This section is informational only, and the definitive version of the
   schema is the one listed in RFC 5261.

Appendix B.  ABNF for RFC 5261

   RFC 5261 [2] does not contain an ABNF grammar for the allowed subset
   of XPath expressions, but includes an XSD-based grammar in its type
   definition for operation types (which is shown in Appendix A).  In
   order to make implementation easier, this appendix contains an ABNF
   grammar that has been derived from the XSD expressions given in RFC

   5261.  In the following grammar, "xpath" is the definition for the
   allowed XPath expressions for remove and replace operations, and
   "xpath-add" is the definition for the allowed XPath expressions for
   add operations.  The names of all grammar productions are the ones
   used in the XSD-based grammar of RFC 5261.
