         <t>The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" defines an XML document structure for expressing a sequence of patch operations that are applied to an XML document. The XML Patch document format's foundations are defined in RFC 5261, this specification defines a document format and a media type registration, so that XML Patch documents can be labeled with a media type, for example in HTTP conversations.</t>
         <t>In addition to the media type registration, this specification also updates RFC 5261 in some aspects, limiting these updates to cases where RFC 5261 needed to be fixed, or was hard to understand.</t>

      <section title="Introduction">
         <t>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) <xref target="RFC3023"/> is a common format for the exchange and storage of structured data. HTTP PATCH <xref target="RFC5789"/> extends HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> with a method to perform partial modifications to resources. HTTP PATCH requires that patch documents be sent along with the request, and it is therefore useful for there to be standardized patch document formats (identified by media types) for popular media types.</t>
         <t>The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" is an XML document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target XML document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method. Servers can freely choose which patch formats they want to accept, and "application/xml-patch+xml" could be a simple default format that can be used unless a server decides to use a different (maybe more sophisticated) patch format for XML.</t>
         <t>The format for patch documents is based on the XML Patch Framework defined in RFC 5261 <xref target="RFC5261"/>. While RFC 5261 does define a concrete syntax as well as the media type "application/patch-ops-error+xml" for error documents, it only defines XML Schema (XSD) <xref target="W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028"/> types for patch operations. The concrete document format and the media type for patch operations are defined in an XSD defined in this specification.</t>
         <t>This specification updates sections of RFC 5261 that need to be fixed, or are hard to understand. The updates are listed in <xref target="rfc5261-updates"/>, and all references to RFC 5261 made in this specification should be read as referring to the updated version. The main reason for the changes are the problematic ways in which RFC 5261 relies on XPath as the expression language for selecting the location of a patch, while at the same time XPath's data model does not contain sufficient information to determine whether such a selector indeed can be used for a patch operation, or should result in an error. Specifically, the problem occurs with namespaces, where XPath does not expose namespace declaration attributes, while the patch model needs them to determine whether a namespace patch is allowed or not. <xref target="implementation-hints"/> contains more information about the general problem, and <xref target="rfc5261-updates"/> lists the resulting updates to RFC 5261 to make the model well-defined and the text easier to read and understand.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Updates to RFC 5261" anchor="rfc5261-updates">
         <t>This section is normative. It contains a list of updates to RFC 5261 <xref target="RFC5261"/>. These updates are limited to cases where RFC 5261 needed to be fixed, or was hard to understand.</t>
         <section title="Section 4.2.2" anchor="update-section-4-2-2">
            <t>Section 4.2.2 of RFC 5261 <xref target="RFC5261"/> says:</t>
            <t>
               <list style="empty">
                  <t>In XPath 2.0, a "bar" selector not only matches an unqualified &lt;bar> element, but also matches a qualified &lt;bar> element that is in scope of a default namespace declaration. In contrast, in this specification, a selector without a prefix only matches one element, and it may match an element with or without a prefix but only if the namespace it's qualified with (or none) is an exact match.</t>
               </list>
            </t>
            <t>It should say:</t>
            <t>
               <list style="empty">
                  <t>In XPath 2.0, a "bar" selector matches elements that have the URI of the "default element/type namespace", which is part of an XPath's static context. By setting this URI to the default namespace of the diff document (or leave it empty, if there is none), XPath 2.0's behavior matches the requirements of the previous section.</t>
               </list>
            </t>
            <t>Explanation: The original text is not easy to understand, but seems to assume that an unprefixed name in XPath 2.0 matches both unprefixed names, and prefixed ones that have the same namespace as the default namespace of the XPath static context. This is not the case: Matching depends on how the "default element/type namespace" of the XPath static context is defined, and then matches either namespace-less elements, or those in the "default element/type namespace", but never both. This context, however, is defined by the XPath itself, not by the document. Thus, it can be set externally and could be set to the diff document's default namespace (if there is one). In that case, XPath 2.0 can be used to evaluate XML Patch selectors.</t>

         <section title="Section 4.4.3" anchor="update-section-4-4-3">
            <t>Section 4.4.3 of RFC 5261 <xref target="RFC5261"/> says:</t>
            <t>
               <list style="empty">
                  <t>4.4.3. Replacing a Namespace Declaration URI</t>
                  <t>An example for a replacement of a namespace URI: &lt;replace sel="doc/namespace::pref">urn:new:xxx&lt;/replace> This will replace the URI value of 'pref' prefixed namespace node with "urn:new:xxx". The parent node of the namespace declaration MUST be the &lt;doc> element, otherwise an error occurs.</t>
               </list>
            </t>
            <t>It should say:</t>
            <t>
               <list style="empty">
                  <t>4.4.3. Replacing a Namespace URI</t>
                  <t>An example for a replacement of a namespace URI: &lt;replace sel="doc/namespace::pref">urn:new:xxx&lt;/replace> This will replace the URI of the namespace associated with the 'pref' prefix with "urn:new:xxx". The parent node of the namespace declaration MUST be the &lt;doc> element, otherwise an error occurs. Replacing the namespace at the element where it is declared MUST also change all namespace nodes derived from this declaration in descendant elements.</t>
               </list>
            </t>
            <t>Explanation: The specification uses the terms "namespace declaration" and "namespace" almost interchangeably, which is incorrect. It is impossible to select namespace declarations using XPath. When selecting and replacing a namespace, then it should be taken into account that its associated namespace declaration very likely has resulted in numerous namespace nodes, attached to descendant elements of the element where the namespace was declared. It is likely that RFC 5261 intended to specify a "recursive replace" of the resulting namespace nodes of a namespace declaration, and this is what the corrected text suggests. The original text is mixing terminology, hard to read, and ambiguous in its meaning.</t>
            <t>Side note: If the original text had indeed tried to specify that only this one namespace node should be changed, then this could lead to rather strange effects in the resulting document, since 1) the XPath tree would now have "orphan" namespace nodes, which 2) then would need to be serialized, and 3) there would be resulting namespace declarations in locations where previously no namespace declarations occurred.</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Section 8" anchor="update-section-8">
            <t>Section 8 of RFC 5261 <xref target="RFC5261"/> says:</t>
            <t>
               <list style="empty">
                  <t>&lt;!ENTITY id     "id\(('&amp;ncname;')?\)|id\((&amp;quot;&amp;ncname;&amp;quot;)?\)"></t>
               </list>
            </t>
            <t>It should say:</t>
            <t>
               <list style="empty">
                  <t>&lt;!ENTITY id     "id\('&amp;ncname;'\)|id\(&amp;quot;&amp;ncname;&amp;quot;\)"></t>
               </list>
            </t>
            <t>Explanation: The regex in the XSD suggests that "id()" would be a valid selector for a patch, but it would not make sense to specify such a selector, since it never would select a node (there is no identifier to locate in the document). This means that while "id()" is a valid XPath expression, it should not be allowed as a selector expression within an XML patch document. </t>

         <section title="XSD for RFC 5261" anchor="rfc5261-xsd">
            <t>This section contains a modified copy of the XML Schema (XSD) <xref target="W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028"/> defining the add, replace, and remove types in RFC 5261 <xref target="RFC5261"/>. The modification is based on the grammar change made in <xref target="update-section-8"/>.</t>

These children follow the semantics defined in RFC 5261, which means that each element is treated as an individual patch operation, and the result of each patch operation is a patched XML document that is the target XML document for the next patch operation.</t>

            <t>As this example demonstrates, both the document element "patch" and the patch operation elements are in the same XML namespace. This is the result of RFC 5261 only defining types for the patch operation elements, which then can be reused in schemas to define concrete patch elements.</t>
            <t>RFC 5261 defines an XML Schema (XSD) <xref target="W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028"/> for the patch operation types, which is shown in <xref target="rfc5261-xsd"/>. The following schema for the XML Patch media type is based on the types defined in RFC 5261, which are imported as "rfc5261.xsd" in the following schema. The schema defines a "patch" document element, and then allows an unlimited (and possibly empty) sequence of the "add", "remove", and "replace" operation elements, which are directly based on the respective types from the schema defined in RFC 5261.</t>

Most importantly, the examples in RFC 5261 can be taken literally as examples for the XML Patch media type, as long as it is assumed that the XML namespace for the operation elements in these examples is the URI "urn:ietf:rfc:XXXX".</t>

                  <t>Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents are widely used as containers for the exchange and storage of arbitrary data in today's systems. In order to send changes to an XML document, an entire copy of the new version must be sent, unless there is a means of indicating only the portions that have changed. This document describes an XML patch framework utilizing XML Path language (XPath) selectors. These selector values and updated new data content constitute the basis of patch operations described in this document. In addition to them, with basic &amp;amp;lt;add&amp;amp;gt;, &amp;amp;lt;replace&amp;amp;gt;, and &amp;amp;lt;remove&amp;amp;gt; directives a set of patches can then be applied to update an existing XML document.

                  <t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.</t>
                  <t>HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068.

      <section title="Implementation Hints" anchor="implementation-hints">
         <t>This section is informative. It described some issues that might be interesting for implementers, but it might also be interesting for users of XML Patch that want to understand some of the differences between standard XPath 1.0 processing, and the processing model of selectors in RFC 5261.</t>
         <section title="Matching Namespaces" anchor="namespace-matching">
            <t>RFC 5261 defines standard rules for matching prefixed names in expressions: Any prefixes are interpreted according to the namespace bindings of the diff document (the document that the expression is applied against). This means that each prefixed name can be interpreted in the context of the diff document.</t>
            <t>For unprefixed names in expressions, the rules depart from XPath 1.0 <xref target="W3C.REC-xpath-19991116"/>. XPath 1.0 defines that unprefixed names in expressions match namespace-less names (i.e., there is no "default namespace" for names used in XPath 1.0 expressions). RFC 5261 requires, however, that unprefixed names in expressions must use the default namespace of the diff document (if there is one). This means that it is not possible to simply take a selector from a patch document and evaluate it in the context of the diff document according to the rules of XPath 1.0, because this would interpret unprefixed names incorrectly. As a consequence, it is not possible to simply take an XPath 1.0 processor and evaluate XMPL Patch selectors in the context of the diff document.</t>
            <t>As an extension of XPath 1.0's simple model, XPath 2.0 <xref target="W3C.REC-xpath20-20101214"/> specifies different processing rules for unprefixed names: They are matched against the URI of the "default element/type namespace", which is defined as part of an expression's static context. In some XPath 2.0 applications, this can be set; XSLT 2.0 for example has the ability to define an "xpath-default-namespace", which then will be used to match unprefixed names in expressions. Thus, by using an XPath 2.0 implementation that allows to set this URI, and setting it to the default namespace of the diff document (or leaving it undefined if there is no such default namespace), it is possible to use an out-of-the-box XPath 2.0 implementation for evaluating XML Patch selectors.</t>
            <t>Please keep in mind, however, that evaluating selectors is only one part of applying patches. When it comes to applying the actual patch operation, neither XPath 1.0 nor XPath 2.0 are sufficient because they do not preserve some of the information from the XML syntax (specifically: namespace declarations) that is required to correctly apply patch operations. The following section describes this issue in more detail.</t>
            <t>Please note that RFC 5261's Section 4.2.2 on namespace matching explains XPath 2.0's rules incorrectly <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261#section-4.2.2"/>. For this reason, <xref target="update-section-4-2-2"/> updates Section 4.2.2 of RFC 5261.</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Patching Namespaces" anchor="namespace-patching">
            <t>One of the issues when patching namespaces based on XPath is that XPath exposes namespaces differently than the XML 1.0 <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/> syntax for XML Namespaces <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-names-20091208"/>. In the XML syntax, a namespace is declared with an attribute using the reserved name or prefix "xmlns", and this results in this namespace being available recursively through the document tree. In XPath, the namespace declaration is not exposed as an attribute (i.e., the attribute, although syntactically an XML attribute, is not accessible in XPath), but the resulting namespace nodes are exposed recursively through the tree.</t>
            <t>RFC 5261 uses the terms "namespace declaration" and "namespace" almost interchangeably, but it is important to keep in mind that the namespace declaration is an XML syntax construct that is unavailable in XPath, while the namespace itself is a logical construct that is not visible in the XML syntax, but a result of a namespace declaration. The intent of RFC 5261 is to patch namespaces as if namespace declarations were patched, and thus it only allows patching namespace nodes on the element nodes where the namespace has been declared.</t>
            <t>Patching namespaces in XML Patch is supposed to "emulate" the effect of actually changing the namespace declaration (which is why a namespace can only be patched at the element where it has been declared). Therefore, when patching a namespace, even though XPath's "namespace" axis is used, implementations have to make sure that not only the single selected namespace node is being patched, but that all namespaces nodes resulting from the namespace declaration of this namespace are also patched accordingly.</t>
            <t>This means that an implementation might have to descend into the tree, matching all namespace nodes with the selected prefix/URI pair recursively, until it encounters leaf elements or namespace declarations with the same prefix it is patching. Determining this requires access to the diff document beyond XPath, because in XPath itself namespace declarations are not represented, and thus such a recursive algorithm wouldn't know when to stop. Consider the following document:</t>

            </figure>
            <t>If this document is patched with a selector of /x/namespace::a, then only the namespace node on element x should be patched, even though the namespace node on element y has the same prefix/URI combination as the one on element x. However, determining that the repeated namespace declaration was present at all on element y is impossible when using XPath alone, which means that implementations must have an alternative way to determine the difference between the document above, and this one:</t>
            <figure>
               <artwork><![CDATA[<x xmlns:a="tag:42">
    <y/>
</x>]]></artwork>
            </figure>
            <t>In this second example, patching with a selector of /x/namespace::a should indeed change the namespace nodes on elements x and y, because they both have been derived from the same namespace declaration.</t>
            <t>The conclusion of these considerations is that for implementing XML Patch, access closer to the XML syntax (specifically: access to namespace declarations) is necessary. As a result, implementations attempting to exclusively use the XPath model for implementing XML Patch will fail to correctly address certain edge cases (such as the one shown above).</t>
            <t>Note that XPath's specific limitations do not mean that it is impossible to use XML technologies other than XPath. The Document Object Model (DOM) <xref target="W3C.REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407"/>, for example, does expose namespace declaration attributes as regular attributes in the document tree, and thus could be used to differentiate between the two variants shown above.</t>
            <t>Please note that RFC 5261's Section 4.4.3 on replacing namespaces mixes the terms "namespace declaration" and "namespace". For this reason, <xref target="update-section-4-4-3"/> updates Section 4.4.3 of RFC 5261.</t>

         <t>Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.</t>
         <t>This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982 <xref target="RFC6982"/>. The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>
         <t>According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".</t>

            <!-- 
RFC 6982: This section, if it appears, should be located just before the "Security Considerations" section and contain, for each existing implementation, some or all of the following:
 -  The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.
 -  The implementation's name and/or a link to a web page describing the implementation.
 -  A brief general description.
 -  The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype, alpha, beta, production, widely used, etc.
 -  Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are implemented and which versions of the Internet-Draft were implemented.
 -  Licensing: the terms under which the implementation can be used. For example: proprietary, royalty licensing, freely distributable with acknowledgement (BSD style), freely distributable with requirement to redistribute source (General Public License (GPL) style), and other (specify).
 -  Implementation experience: any useful information the implementers want to share with the community.
 -  Contact information: ideally a person's name and email address, but possibly just a URL or mailing list.

               <t>EMC: EMC's IIG unit has implemented the selector part of the specification, which is the trickiest part (see <xref target="namespace-matching"/> for an explanation). By reusing an existing XPath 1.0 implementation and changing it to match the changed default namespace processing model, the required behavior is fairly easy to implement. This does, however, require that the implementation is available in source code, and also does require some changes to the implementation's code. The resulting implementation is closed source and will be made available, if released, as part of EMC's XML database product xDB <eref target="http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software2/documentum-xdb.htm"/>.</t>
