      <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
         <t>As a general rule, URIs should be stable and persistent, so that applications can use them as stable and persistent identifiers for resources. However, there are many scenarios where for a variety of reasons, URIs have a limited lifetime. In some of these scenarios, this limited lifetime is known in advance. In this case, it can be useful for resources to make this information about their limited lifetime known. This specification defines the Sunset HTTP response header field, which indicates that a URI is likely to become unresponsive at a point in the future.</t>
         <t>Possible scenarios for known lifetimes of resources include, but are not limited to the following:</t>
         <t>
            <list>
               <t>Retention: There are many cases where regulation or legislation require that resources are kept available for a certain amount of time. However, in many cases there also is a requirement for those resources to be permanently deleted. Since the deletion of the resource in this scenario is governed by well-defined rules, it could be made explicit for clients accessing the resource.</t>
               <t>Migration: If resources are changing identity because a service migrates them, then this may be known in advance. While it may not yet be appropriate to use HTTP redirect status codes (3xx), it may be interesting for clients to learn about the service's plan to take down the original resource.</t>
               <t>Temporary Resources: Some resources may have a limited lifetime by definition. For example, a pending order represented by a resource may already list all the details of the order, but may only exist for a limited time unless it is confirmed and then becomes permanent. In such a case, the service managing the pending order can make this limited lifetime explicitly, allowing clients to understand that the pending order, unless confirmed, will disappear at some point in time.</t>

               <t>Human readable explanation: It would be possible to include human-readable information about the reason for the URI's disappearance. This could either be done inline (probably just a simple string), and/or by reference to a URI that will dereference to human-readable information.</t>
               <t>Machine-readable explanation: It would be possible to include machine-readable information about the reason for the URI's disappearance. This could either be done inline (maybe name/value pairs), and/or by reference to a URI that will dereference to machine-readable information.</t>
               <t>New URI: If the resource's new URI is known (for example when a service is migrating in a way that invalidates existing URIs, but has a plan of how these will map to new URIs), then that URI could be advertised in advance (i.e., it's not yet a 3xx, but clients might want to start working with the new URI anyway).</t>
