         <t>Registries on the Internet and the Web fulfill a wide range of tasks, ranging from low-level networking aspects such as packet type identifiers, all the way to application-level protocols and standards. This document summarizes some of the reasons of why and how to use registries, and how some of them are operated. It serves as a informative reference for specification writers considering whether to create and manage a registry, allowing them to better understand some of the issues associated with certain design discussions.</t>

      <section title="Introduction">
         <t>Technologies and standards in computer networking have long used the concept of a "Registry" as a place where well-known information is available and managed. In most case, the main reason to use a registry is to create a technology or standard that has stable parts (the technology/standard itself), as well as some parts that are supposed to evolve, even though the technology/standard itself remains stable and unchanged.</t>
         <t>A registry essentially is a pattern of how to separate those two aspects of a technology/standard, allowing the technology/standard to remain stable, while the parts of it referencing the registry can evolve over time by changing the registry contents. For specification writers, this has proven to be a useful and successful pattern. The "Protocol Registries" maintained by the "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)" have steadily increased in number, at the time of writing (January 2016), the <xref target="IANA-Protocol-Registry"/> contains 1903 individual registries. This number indicates that registries as a "protocol specification pattern" are quite popular and successful.</t>
         <t>Deciding if a specification should use a registry is not an easy task. It involves identifying those parts that should be kept stable (in the specification itself), and those that should be managed in one or more registries for ongoing management and evolution. Even after identifying this split, it is necessary to define how exactly the registry part(s) should be managed, involving questions such as submission procedures, review processes, revocation/change management, and access to the registry contents for the worldwide developer community.</t>
         <t>This document is intended to provide an overview to specification developers in terms of why, when, and how to use registries. It is not meant to provide definitive guidance, but more intended as a reference to consider the different ways in which the general "registry pattern" can be used, and what the possible side-effects on some of these solutions may be.</t>

      <section title="Why to use Registries">
         <t>Establishing and using a registry can be done for a number of reasons. The following sections list some of these reasons, and in many cases, registries are used for at least some of the reasons described here.</t>
         <section title="Openness and Extensibility">
            <t>...</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Limited Namespaces">
            <t>Historically, registries started managing the very limited namespace of identifier fields in protocol packets or other low-level mechanisms such as the port numbers described in <xref target="ports"/>, often limited to a small number of bits or bytes. Carefully managing this very limited set of available identifiers was important, as was a way to allow new values to be added without having to update the protocol specification itself.</t>
            <t>The higher the level is on which registries are used, the more likely it is that namespaces at least on the technical level are not very constrained. For example, the link relation described in <xref target="links"/> are using strings as identifiers without imposing a length limitations, meaning that the set of possible identifiers is virtually inexhaustible. However, even in this case, the set of helpful and meaningful identifiers (i.e., names that are human-readable and partly self-describing) is limited, and thus even in this case, the realistically useful namespace is much more limited that the theoretical one.</t>
         </section>
         <section title="Design/Usage Review">
            <t>Registries are established in the context of a given specification, and provide a mechanism to make this specification extensible by allowing the registry to evolve over time. However, the context of the specification very often has a clear design rationale for why a registry is established for a certain set of values. Any value added or changed in the registry should fit into this context, and having a registry provides an opportunity to have design and usage reviews before the registry gets updated.</t>
            <t>For design and usage reviews to work well, the most crucial aspect is that the context of the registry is well-defined, and states clearly what kind of expectations the design and usage review will be checking. Often this review process is implemented using a mailing list and designated experts, so that registration requests as well as results of the deign and usage review are done openly and transparently.</t>
