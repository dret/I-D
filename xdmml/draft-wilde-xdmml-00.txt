1.  Introduction

   ....


2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Media Type

   The Internet media type [4] for an XDMML document is application/
   xdm+xml (using the "+xml" suffix as defined and registered by RFC
   6839 [5]).

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: xdm+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: none

      Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of
      application/xml as specified in [1].

      Security considerations: This media type has all of the security
      considerations described in [1], plus those listed in Section 3.

      Interoperability considerations: N/A

      Published specification: RFC XXXX

      Applications that use this media type: Applications that want to
      serialize or consume instances of XDM.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s): none

         File extension(s): XML data should use ".xml" as the file
         extension.

         Macintosh file type code(s): TEXT

      Person & email address to contact for further information: Erik
      Wilde <erik.wilde@emc.com>

5.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   As explained in a draft currently under development
   <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sheffer-running-code>, this section
   contains information about implementation status, so that reviews of
   the draft document can take implementation reports into account as
   well.  If you are implementing this draft, please contact this
   draft's authors.  Any implementation status reports are intended for
   draft publications only; the section will be removed when the draft
   is published in RFC form.
