            <t><xref target="RFC5988">RFC 5988</xref> specifies the HTTP "Link" header as a means to 
            convey typed links in HTTP responses. The links are provided as the payload of the "Link" header 
            using a syntax specified by the RFC. 
            Cases exist in which providing links by value is impractical or impossible. In these cases, 
            an approach to provide links by reference is desired. This specification defines the 
            "linkset" relation type that allows doing so.</t>

            <section title="Large Number of Links" anchor="link-volume">
                <t>Cases exist in which a significant number of links needs to be conveyed, 
                and, as a result, the payload of the HTTP "Link" header becomes large. It is possible to 
                statically configure a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response headers by 
                specifying an upper boundary for their size. But, when 
                the number of links and the amount of bytes required for each is unpredictable estimating 
                a reliable upper boundary is challenging. This is, for example, the case when links 
                are determined dynamically dependent on a range of contextual factors. While HTTP 
                [<xref target="RFC2616">RFC 2616</xref>] defines error 
                codes related to excess communication by the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" 
                and "414 Request-URI Too Long"), no error codes are defined to indicate that a response header exceeds  
                the upper boundary that can be handled by the server.
                Applications take counter measures aimed at controlling the size of the HTTP "Link" header, 
                for example, by limiting the links they provide to those with select relation types, 
                thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients. Providing links by reference, 
                instead of by value, overcomes challenges related to the unpredictable nature of the 
                extent of HTTP "Link" headers.
                </t>

            <section title="Third-Party Links" anchor="third-party">
                <t>Cases exist in which a server other than the responding server is better placed to provide 
                links. That other server - the linking server - may be managed by the same custodian as the responding server 
                or by a third party trusted by the custodian of the responding server. In both cases, 
                the linking server exposes links pertaining to web resources made available by 
                the responding server. In order for the responding server to 
                provide up-to-date links in the HTTP "Link" header, it needs to obtain them 
                from the link server prior to responding to a client. 
                Doing so increases latency, which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent on 
                consuming links. Providing links by reference, 
                instead of by value, removes this additional latency by avoiding server-to-server 
                communication required to obtain links.

        <section title="Link Relation for Identifying Link Sets" anchor="linkset-link-relation">
            <t>The "linkset" relation type can be used to refer to a resource that provides 
            a set of links. Typically the Context IRI of these links  
            is the URI of the responding resource but other Context IRIs MAY be used. 
            </t>
            <t>
            More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY 
            be provided. Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed using different 
            serializations or to different sets of links. 
            The use of a link with the "linkset" relation type does not preclude the 
            provision of links with other relation types. 
            </t>
            <t>The entity-body of a response from the Target IRI of a link with the 
                "linkset" relation type MAY be serialized in various ways, 
                but the link-value format serialization described here MUST be supported. 
                In this serialization, the entity-body MUST be formatted in the 
                same way as the value of an HTTP "Link" header, 
                and hence MUST comply to the "link-value" construction rule of Section 5 
                of RFC 5988 <xref target="RFC5988"/>, and the media type of the 
                entity-body MUST be "application/link-format" as introduced in RFC 6690 <xref target="RFC6690"/>. 
                The Context IRI of links contained in the entity-body MUST be interpreted as follows:
            </t>
            <t>
                <list>
                    <t>The Context IRI is the URI in the anchor parameter, when provided.</t>
                    <t>The Context IRI is the URI of the resource that conveys the 
                        link with the "linkset" relation type, when the anchor parameter is not provided.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>For self-containdeness, the use of anchors for all links is RECOMMENDED.</t>
