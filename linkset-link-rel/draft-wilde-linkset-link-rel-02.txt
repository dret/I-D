1.  Introduction

   A hypermedia resource typically conveys typed Web Links [RFC5988] as
   an inherent part of the resource's representation [RFC7231], for
   example, using the <link> element for HTML representations, or the
   "Link" header field in HTTP response headers for representations of
   any media type.  Cases exist in which providing links by value is
   impractical or impossible.  In these cases, an approach to provide
   links by reference is desired.  This specification defines the
   "linkset" relation type that allows doing so.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Scenarios

3.1.  Third-Party Links

   Cases exist in which a service other than the one providing a
   resource is expected to provide links for that resource.  This
   "third-party link resource" is hosted by a link server that may be
   managed by the same custodian as the responding resource, or by a
   third party.  In order for the responding server to provide up-to-
   date and complete links about its resources, it would need to obtain
   them from the link server, and embed them in the resource
   representations prior to responding to a client.  Doing so increases
   latency and load, which may be unnecessary if a client is not intent
   on consuming links.  Providing links by reference, instead of by
   value, removes this additional latency by avoiding server-to-server
   communication required to obtain links.

3.2.  Large Number of Links

   When conveying links in the HTTP "Link" header, cases exist in which
   the size of the HTTP response header becomes unpredictable.  This is,
   for example, the case when links are determined dynamically dependent
   on a range of contextual factors.  It is possible to statically
   configure a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response
   headers by specifying an upper boundary for their size.  But when the
   number of links and the amount of bytes required for each is
   unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper boundary is challenging.
   While HTTP [RFC7231] defines error codes related to excess
   communication by the user agent ("413 Request Entity Too Large" and
   "414 Request-URI Too Long"), no error codes are defined to indicate
   that a response header exceeds the upper boundary that can be handled
   by the server.  As a result, applications take counter measures aimed
   at controlling the size of the HTTP "Link" header, for example, by
   limiting the links they provide to those with select relation types,
   thereby limiting the value of the HTTP "Link" header to clients.
   Providing links by reference, instead of by value, overcomes
   challenges related to the unpredictable nature of the extent of HTTP
   "Link" headers.

4.  Origin Resource, Link Set Resource, "linkset" Relation Type

   This section introduces two types of resources involved in providing
   links by reference, as well as the link relation type used to
   interlink them.

Internet-Draft         Linkset Link Relation Type               May 2017


4.1.  Origin Resource

   An "origin resource" is a resource that makes links in which it
   participates discoverable by providing a typed link that targets a
   link set resource.

   Depending on the scenario, the origin resource can be a URI-
   identified resource or a fragment of a URI-identified resource.

4.2.  Link Set Resource

   A "link set resource" is a resource - other than the origin resource
   - with a representation that provides one or more links in which the
   origin resource participates as source or target.

   Because the link set resource is distinct from the origin resource,
   links provided by the link set resource must explicitly express both
   the source and target of each link as a means to allow unambiguous
   interpretation.

4.3.  The "linkset" Relation Type for Linking to Link Sets

   A link with the "linkset" link relation type has as Context IRI the
   IRI of an origin resource, and as Target IRI the IRI of an associated
   link set resource.

   A link with the "linkset" relation type MAY be provided in the header
   and/or the body of the origin resource's representation.

   More than one link with a "linkset" relation type MAY be provided.
   Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links expressed
   using different representations, or to different link sets.

   The use of a link with the "linkset" relation type does not preclude
   the provision of links with other relation types, i.e. the origin
   resource can provide typed links other than a "linkset" link.

   The link set resource MAY provide the links that pertain to the
   origin resource in its response header and/or body:

   o  In cases whereby the link set resource provides these links in its
      Link response header, the payload of that header MUST comply with
      the syntax defined in [RFC5988].  The media type of the response
      body is not constrained.

   o  In cases whereby the link set resource provides these links in its
      response body, the body MUST allow a user-agent to unambiguously

Internet-Draft         Linkset Link Relation Type               May 2017


      determine the source and target of each provided link.  The media
      type of the response body is otherwise not constrained.

   The syntax of the Target IRI of a link with the "linkset" relation
   type is not specified and is left to the discretion of implementers.
   However, it is assumed that an unmabiguous association with the
   origin resource that provides the link to the Target IRI can be
   derived.

5.  A JSON Format for Link Sets

   Possibly, a format and media type are defined here.

6.  Examples

   Sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 show examples whereby the link
   set resource provides links pertaining to the origin resource, in its
   response header and body, respectively.

6.1.  Links Provided in the Header of the Link Set Resource

   Figure 1 shows a client issuing an HTTP head request against origin
   resource http://example.org/resource1.

   HEAD /resource1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Connection: close


                    Figure 1: Client HTTP HEAD Request

   Figure 2 shows the response to the HEAD request of Figure 1.  The
   response contains a Link header with a link that has the "linkset"
   relation type.  It indicates that links pertaining to the origin
   resource are provided by link set resource http://example.com/
   links?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fresource.

            Figure 2: Response to HTTP HEAD on Origin Resource

   Figure 3 shows the client issuing an HTTP GET request against the
   link set resource provided in Figure 2.

   GET /links?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fresource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Connection: close


          Figure 3: Client HTTP GET against the Link Set Resource

   Figure 4 shows the response headers to the HTTP GET request of
   Figure 3.  The links pertaining to the origin resource are provided
   in the Link response header of the link set resource.  As can be
   seen, in order to support an unambiguous determination of the Context
   IRI of each link, the "anchor" attribute is provided for each link.
   Note that most, but not all, links have the origin resource as
   Context IRI (anchor).
