                   The Deprecation HTTP Header Field
                   draft-wilde-deprecation-header-00

Abstract

   The HTTP Deprecation header field can be used to signal to consumers
   of an URI-identified resource that the use of the resource will be or
   has been deprecated, by using a timestamp in the future or in the
   past.  Additionally, the deprecation link relation can be used to
   link to a resource that provides additional context for the
   deprecation, and possibly ways in which clients can find a
   replacement for the deprecated resource.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  The Deprecation Response Header Field

   The Deprecation response header field should be added to the
   permanent registry of message header fields (see [RFC3864]), taking
   into account the guidelines given by HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231].

Internet-Draft           HTTP Deprecation Header            January 2019


      Header Field Name: Deprecation

      Applicable Protocol: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

      Status: Informational

      Author/Change controller: IETF

      Specification document(s): RFC XXXX

5.2.  The Deprecation Link Relation Type

   The deprecation link relation type should be added to the permanent
   registry of link relation types according to Section 4.2 of RFC 8288
   [RFC8288]:

      Relation Name: deprecation

      Description: ...

      Reference: RFC XXXX

6.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982
   [RFC6982].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
