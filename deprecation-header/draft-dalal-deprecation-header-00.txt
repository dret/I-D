                      The Deprecation HTTP Header
                   draft-dalal-deprecation-header-00

Abstract

   The HTTP Deprecation response header can be used to signal to
   consumers of a URI-identified resource that the use of the resource
   has been deprecated.  Additionally, the deprecation link relation can
   be used to link to a resource that provides additional context for
   the deprecation, and possibly ways in which clients can find a
   replacement for the deprecated resource.

1.  Introduction

   Deprecation of a URI-identified resource is a technique to
   communicate information about the lifecycle of a resource.  It
   encourages applications to migrate away from the resource and
   discourage applications from forming new dependencies on the
   resource, and informs applications of the risk of continuing
   dependence upon the resource.

   The act of deprecation does not change any behavior of the resource.
   It just informs client of the fact that a resource is deprecated.
   The Deprecation HTTP response header field MAY be used to convey this
   fact at runtime to clients.  The header field can carry additional
   information such as since when the deprecation is in effect.

   In addition to the Deprecation header field the resource provider can
   use other header fields to convey additional information related to
   deprecation.  For example, information such as where to find
   documentation related to the deprecation or what should be used as an
   alternate and when the deprecated resource would be unreachable, etc.

   Alternates of a resource can be similar resource(s) or a newer
   version of the same resource.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] and includes, by reference, the "token" rule,
   DQUOTE (double quote) rule, the SP (space) rule and the "rule"
   extension that allows for compact definition of comma-separated lists
   using a '#' operator (similar to how the '*' operator indicates
   repetition), HTTP-date rule as defined within Sections 3.2.6 and 7 of
   [RFC7230] and Section 7.1.1 of [RFC7231].

2.  The Deprecation HTTP Response Header Field

   The "Deprecation" HTTP response header field allows a server to
   communicate to a client that the URI-identified resource in context
   of the message is deprecated.  It can also provide information that
   the resource is deprecated since which version.

2.1.  Syntax

   The "Deprecation" response header contains the header name
   "Deprecation" followed by a ":" and a property(s).  Each property
   consists of a name-value-pair.  Servers SHOULD NOT send Deprecation
   headers that fail to conform to the following grammar:

   deprecation-header = "Deprecation:" SP "version"=vval, "date"=dval,
                        *( extension )
   extension = property-name "=" property-value
   property-name = DQUOTE token DQUOTE
   token = <token, defined as in [RFC7230], Section 3.2.6>
   vval = property-value
   property-value = DQUOTE *( pchar ) DQUOTE
   pchar = %x23 / %x2B-3A / %x41-5A / %x61-7A / %x7C
         ; US-ASCII characters
   dval = DQUOTE HTTP-date DQUOTE

   Note that some of the grammatical terms above reference documents
   that use different grammatical notations than this document (which
   uses ABNF from [RFC5234]).

Internet-Draft         The Deprecation HTTP Header         February 2019


   Servers SHOULD NOT include more than one "Deprecation" header field
   in the same response.  If a server sends multiple responses
   containing "Deprecation" headers concurrently to the user agent
   (e.g., when communicating with the user agent over multiple sockets),
   these responses create a "race condition" that can lead to
   unpredictable behavior.

   The value of "Deprecation" response header field could consist of at
   least 1 standard property: "date" or "version" as shown below.
   Either of "version" or "date" is REQUIRED and both are also allowed.

   Deprecation: version="version", date="date"

2.1.1.  Version

   The value of the "version" property, if present, could be the version
   of the resource that is deprecated.  The value of "version" would be
   an opaque version identifier.  For resources that use date-based
   versioning scheme, the value would be accordingly.

   Following example indicates that the version v1 of the resource in
   context is deprecated.

   Deprecation: version="v1"

   Following example shows that the version 2018-11-08 (November 8,
   2018) of the resource in context is deprecated.  Here the versioning
   scheme used is date-based.

   Deprecation: version="2018-11-08"

2.1.2.  Date

   The value of "date" property, if present, would be the date when
   resource was deprecated.  It would be in the form of a quoted HTTP-
   date timestamp, as defined in Section 7.1.1.1 of [RFC7231].

   Following example shows that the resource in context is deprecated on
   Friday, November 11, 2018 at 23:59:59 GMT.

   Deprecation: date="Fri, 11 Nov 2018 23:59:59 GMT"

   Date could be in future too.  If the value of "date" is in future, it
   means that the resource would be deprecated on the given date in
   future.

3.  The Deprecation Link Relation Type

   In addition to the Deprecation HTTP header, the server could use a
   "Link" header(s) to communicate to the client where to find more
   information about deprecation of the resource in context.  This
   information could be in the form of documentation of the resource
   including details about the deprecation related aspects of the
   resource or the deprecation policy of the resource provider or both
   for example.

3.1.  Documentation

   For a URI-identified resource, deprecation could involve one or more
   parts of request, response or both.  These parts could be one or more
   of the following.

   o  URI - deprecation of one ore more query parameter(s) or path
      element(s)

   o  method - HTTP method for the resource is deprecated

   o  request header - one or more HTTP request header(s) is deprecated

   o  response header - HTTP response header(s) is deprecated

   o  request body - request body contains one or more deprecated
      element(s)

   o  response body - response body contains one or more deprecated
      element(s)

   The purpose of the "Deprecation" header is to provide just enough
   "hints" about the deprecation to the client application developer.
   It is safe to assume that on reception of the "Deprecation" header,
   the client developer would look up the resource's documentation in
   order to find deprecation related semantics.  The resource developer
   could provide a link to the resource documentation using a "Link"
   header with relation type "deprecation" as shown below.

   Deprecation: version="v1"
   Link: <https://developer.example.com/v1/customers>; rel="deprecation"
          type="text/html"

   where content at "https://developer.example.com/v1/customers" would
   be annotated to show deprecation of the relevant parts of the
   "customers" resource.

Internet-Draft         The Deprecation HTTP Header         February 2019


3.2.  Policy

   Resource provider would typically document versioning and deprecation
   policy with the resource documentation.  To inform the client
   application developer of the deprecation policy, the resource
   provider could use the "deprecation" relation type as shown below.

   Deprecation: version="v1"
   Link: <https://developer.example.com/deprecation>; rel="deprecation"
          type="text/html"

   where deprecation policy of the resource provider "example.com" is
   described at "https://developer.example.com/deprecation".

4.  Recommend Replacement

   "Link" [RFC8288] header could be used in addition to the
   "Deprecation" header to recommend the client application about
   available alternates to the deprecated resource.  Following relation
   types as defined in [RFC8288] are RECOMMENDED to use for the purpose.

   o  "successor-version": Points to a resource containing the successor
      version.  [RFC5829]

   o  "latest-version": Points to a resource containing the latest
      (e.g., current) version.  [RFC5829]

   o  "alternate": Designates a substitute.  [W3C.REC-html401-19991224]

   Following example provides link to the successor version of the v1
   version of "customer" resource that is deprecated.

   Deprecation: version="v1"
   Link: <https://api.example.com/v2/customers>; rel="successor-version"

   This example provides link to an alternate resource to the "customer"
   resource that is deprecated.

   Deprecation: version="2018-11-11"
   Link: <https://api.example.com/v1/clients>; rel="alternate"

5.  Sunset

   In addition to the deprecation related information, if the resource
   provider wants to convey to the client application that the
   deprecated resource is expected to become unresponsive at a specific
   point in time, the [Sunset] header could be used in addition to the
   "Deprecation" header.

   Following example indicates that the resource in context has been
   deprecated since version v2 and its sunset date is Friday, November
   11, 2020 at 23:59:59 GMT.

   Deprecation: version="v2"
   Sunset: Fri, 11 Nov 2020 23:59:59 GMT

   Following example shows that the resource in context has been
   deprecated since Friday, November 11, 2018 at 23:59:59 GMT and its
   sunset date is Friday, November 11, 2020 at 23:59:59 GMT.

   Deprecation: date="Fri, 11 Nov 2018 23:59:59 GMT"
   Sunset: Fri, 11 Nov 2020 23:59:59 GMT

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  The Deprecation Response Header Field

   The "Deprecation" response header should be added to the permanent
   registry of message header fields (see [RFC3864]), taking into
   account the guidelines given by HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231].

7.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.  Security Considerations

   The content of a "Link" header field is not secure, private or
   integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised when using
   it.  Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) with HTTP ([RFC7230] is
   currently the only end-to-end way to provide such protection.

   The suggested "Link" header fields make extensive use of IRIs and
   URIs.  See [RFC3987] for security considerations relating to IRIs.
   See [RFC3986] for security considerations relating to URIs.  See
   [RFC7230] for security considerations relating to HTTP headers.

   Applications that take advantage of typed links should consider the
   attack vectors opened by automatically following, trusting, or
   otherwise using links gathered from the HTTP headers.  In particular,
   Link headers that use the "successor-version", "latest-version" or
   "alternate" relation types should be treated with due caution.  See
   [RFC5829] for security considerations relating to these link relation
   types.
