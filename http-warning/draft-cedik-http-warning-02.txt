1.  Introduction

   Many current APIs are based on HTTP [RFC7230] as their application
   protocol.  Their response handling model is based on the assumption
   that requests either are successful or they fail.  In both cases
   (success and failure) an HTTP status code [RFC7231] is returned to
   convey either fact.

   But response status is not always strictly either success or failure.
   For example, there are cases where an underlying system returns a
   response with data that cannot be defined as a clear error.  API
   providers who are integrating such a service might want to return a
   success response nonetheless, but returning a HTTP status code of
   e.g. 200 OK without any additional information is not the only
   possible approach in this case.

   As defined in the principles of Web architecture
   [W3C.REC-webarch-20041215], agents that "recover from errors by
   making a choice without the user's consent are not acting on the
   user's behalf".  Therefore APIs should be able to communicate what
   has happened to their consumers, which then allows clients or users
   to make more informed decisions.  Note that this specification
   specifically targets warnings and not errors, meaning that while it
   may be useful for clients to understand the warning condition and act
   on it, they also may choose to ignore it and treat the response as a
   successful one.

   This document defines a warning code and a standard response
   structure for communicating and representing warning information in
   HTTP APIs.  The goal is to allow HTTP providers to have a
   standardized way of communicating to their consumers that while the
   response can be considered to represent success, there is warning
   information available that they might want to take into account.

   As a general guideline, warning information should be considered to
   be any information that can be safely ignored (treating the response
   as if it did not communicate or embed any warning information), but
   that might help clients and users to make better decisions.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Content-Warning Field

   The Content-Warning field can be found in the header or trailer
   section (see Section 4.6 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics]) of http
   responses and allows to represent different kinds of warning
   information via HTTP.  It is defined as a Structured Header List
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure].  Its ABNF is:

   Content-Warning = sh-list

   Each member of the list MUST have exactly the two parameters "type"
   and "date".

   o  The "type" parameter represents the warning that is being
      signaled.  Its value is defined as a sh-token and SHOULD be a type
      that is registered in the Content-Warning type registry
      Section 9.2.  Clients SHOULD ignore Content-Warning types that
      they do not know.

Internet-DraftCommunicating Warning Information in HTTP APSeptember 2020


   o  The "date" parameter defines the last occurrence of this warning
      as a structured headers date as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-binary-structured-headers] (e.g. "1581410465").

   Intermediaries of a response are not allowed to modify existing
   Content-Warning fields, but can add additional entries if warnings
   are produced while they are handling a response.

3.1.  HTTP request methods

   The Content-Warning Field is not tied to any specific HTTP request
   method, although specific values MAY only be used with a single or a
   subset of methods.  The information as to which HTTP request methods
   are support for a single Content-Warning Type MUST be defined in the
   definition of the Content-Warning Type.

4.  The "embedded-warning" Content-Warning Type

   This document introduces the Content-Warning Type "embedded-warning".

   As mentioned in the introduction (Section 1), HTTP requests can be
   successful or they can fail.  They can also result in a state where
   the original intent was satisfied, but a side effect happened that
   should be conveyed back to the client.

   To make it easier for clients to handle such an event, the Content-
   Warning type "embedded-warning" MAY be returned.  In this case, the
   client MAY either treat the response according to its HTTP status
   code, or in addition the client MAY use the embedded warning
   information to understand the nature of the warning.

   The "embedded-warning" type does not prescribe the way in which
   warnings are represented.  The assumption is that the response will
   have embedded information that allows the client to learn about the
   nature of the warning.  The following section describes a JSON
   structure that MAY be used to represent the warning.  HTTP services
   are free to use this or other formats to represent the warning
   information they are embedding.

   An exemplary Content-Warning field looks like this:

   Content-Warning: "embedded-warning"; 1590190500

4.1.  Allowed HTTP request methods for embedded-warning

   The embedded-warning Content-Warning Type infers, that there is more
   information in the responses body.  Therefore all HTTP request

Internet-DraftCommunicating Warning Information in HTTP APSeptember 2020


   methods that MAY have content in their body MAY also return embedded
   warnings.

   HTTP request methods that do not return a body in their response
   SHOULD NOT return the embedded-warning Content-Warning Type.

   The HTTP request method HEAD is an exception since it is allowed to
   return headers that are meant for being returned when sending a GET
   request.  Therefore it MAY return the embedded-warning Content-
   Warning Type, although the body will be empty.

5.  JSON Warning Format

   The JSON warning format uses the JSON format described in [RFC8259].
   It is intended to be used as a building block in the response schemas
   of JSON-based APIs.

   In many current designs of JSON-based HTTP APIs, services represent
   response data as members of the returned JSON object.  In order to
   make it easier for consumers to identify information about warnings,
   a top-level member is defined that contains all warning information
   in a representation.  A "warnings" member MUST encapsulate the
   warnings that will be returned to the client.

   When a condition occurs that can not be defined as a "hard error"
   (i.e., that allows clients to continue treating the resulting
   response as a success), additional information about this condition
   SHOULD be returned to the client.  The "warnings" member MUST be an
   array that is structured with one object for each and every warning
   message that is returned to the client.

   Entries in these individual objects follow the pattern described in
   [RFC7807].

   When warnings are present the Content-Warning field (as defined in
   Section 3) SHOULD be set to indicate that warnings have be returned.
   This way a client will not have to parse the response body to find
   out whether a warnings member is present.

6.  Example with HTTP Field and Embedded Warning

   Since warnings do not have an effect on the returned HTTP status
   code, the response status code SHOULD be in the 2xx range, indicating
   that the intent of the client was successful.

   POST /example HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/json

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Warning: "embedded-warning"; 1590190500

   {
     "request_id": "2326b087-d64e-43bd-a557-42171155084f",
     "warnings": [
       {
         "detail": "Street name was too long. It has been shortened...",
         "instance": "https://example.com/shipments/3a186c51/msgs/c94d",
         "status": "200",
         "title": "Street name too long. It has been shortened.",
         "type": "https://example.com/errors/shortened_entry"
       },
       {
         "detail": "City for this zipcode unknown. Code for shipment..",
         "instance": "https://example.com/shipments/3a186c51/msgs/5927",
         "status": "200",
         "title": "City for zipcode unknown.",
         "type": "https://example.com/errors/city_unknown"
       }
     ],
     "id": "3a186c51d4281acb",
     "carrier_tracking_no": "84168117830018",
     "tracking_url": "http://example.com/3a186c51d",
     "label_url": "http://example.com/shipping_label_3a186c51d.pdf",
     "price": 3.4
   }

   This example shows that the original intent was successful.  If the
   original request was in fact not successful, a different status code
   SHOULD be returned.  Embedded warnings are not tied to a specific
   http status code.  Therefore they can be combined with every status
   code.

7.  Cache Considerations

   The Content-Warning field itself does not encourage a specific
   handling when it comes to caching responses.  It is up to the
   Content-Warning type to specify if caching can be used or not.

7.1.  Caching the "embedded-warning" Content-Warning type

   The reasons for returning the Content-Warning Type "embedded-warning"
   can be manifold.  A system could e.g. return warnings due to
   circumstances in the backend that can either still exist on
   subsequent requests or that have been solved in the meantime.

   Intermediaries can fall into the same category.  When a warning
   occurs, it can add warnings to the response making it possible to
   debug what happened at the intermediary.  The reason for said warning
   can persist or may disappear on subsequent requests.

   Therefore caching embedded-warnings SHOULD NOT be done.  As one can't
   predict if the reason for returning embedded-warnings is still
   persistent.

8.  Security Considerations

   API providers need to exercise care when reporting warnings.
   Malicious actors could use this information for orchestrating
   attacks.  Social engineering can also be a factor when warning
   information is returned by the API.

   Clients processing warning information SHOULD make sure the right
   type of content was transmitted by checking the content-type header
   as well as the content-warning field.  Content in the bodys warnings
   object SHOULD be processed accordingly.  If no content-warning field
   was provided, clients are advised to ignore the content provided in
   the bodys warnings object.

8.1.  Absence of a response body

   As described in Section 4.1 the embedded-warning Content-Warning type
   is expecting a body to be returned in the http response unless the
   HEAD method has been used for the request.

   Therefore API clients SHOULD only parse a responses' body when the
   Content-Warning type is "embedded-warning".  When the body is absent,
   a client SHOULD stop processing the response and return an adequate
   error message.

   If an intermediary discovers a missing response body it MAY adjust
   the response to return a http status code of 500 - internal server
   error (see Section 6.6.1 of [RFC7231]).

8.2.  Absence of warnings in the response body

   When the response body does not contain warnings a client MAY use
   appropriate ways to inform the api provider about the fact.  An error
   message MAY be

   If an intermediary discovers missing warnings in the response body it
   MAY adjust the response to return warnings containing this
   information.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  HTTP Field Content-Warning

   This specification registers the following entry in the Permanent
   Message Field Names registry established by [RFC3864]:

   o  Field name: Content-Warning

   o  Applicable protocol: HTTP

   o  Status: standard

   o  Author/Change Controller: IETF

   o  Specification document(s): [this document]

   o  Related information:

9.2.  Content-Warning Type Registry

   The "Content-Warning Type Registry" defines the namespace for new
   Content-Warning types.  This specification establishes a new registry
   according to the guidelines given in [RFC8126].  This new registry
   should not be included in an existing group of registries.

9.2.1.  Registration Procedure

   A registration MUST include the following fields:

   o  Content-Warning Type: Name of the Content-Warning Type

   o  Reference: Pointer to a specification text

   The registration policy for this registry is "Specification Required"
   as defined by [RFC8126], Section 4.6.  They MUST follow the "sh-
   token" syntax defined by [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure].
