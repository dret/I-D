1.  Introduction

   Many current APIs are based on HTTP [RFC7230] as their underlying
   protocol.  Their response handling model is based on the assumption
   that requests either are successful or they fail.  In both cases
   (success and fail) an HTTP response status code [RFC7231] is returned
   to convey either fact.

   But response status is not always strictly either success or failure.
   For example, there are cases where an underlying system returns a
   response with data that cannot be defined as a clear error.  API
   providers who are integrating such a service will have to return a
   correct response nonetheless, but returning a HTTP status code of
   e.g. 200 OK without any additional information is not entirely
   correct in this case.

   As defined in the principles of Web architecture
   [W3C.REC-webarch-20041215], agents that "recover from errors by

   making a choice without the user's consent are not acting on the
   user's behalf".  Therefore APIs should be able to communicate what
   has happened to their consumers.

   This document defines a warning code and a standard response format
   for warning information in HTTP APIs.  The goal is to allow HTTP
   providers to have a standardized way of communicating to their
   consumers that while the response can be considered to be a non-
   failure, there is some warning information available that they might
   want to take into account.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Warning header

   As described in section 5.5 of [RFC7234] the Warning header field "is
   used to carry additional information about the status or
   transformation of a message that might not be reflected in the status
   code".  The field itself consists of the warn-code, a warn-agent, a
   warn-text and an optional warn-date.

   As noted in the introduction (Section 1), http requests can be
   successful or fail.  Or they can have a state where the original
   intent was satisified, but a side effect got introduced that should
   be conveyed back to the client.

   To make it easier for clients to handle such an event, a warning
   header using the warn-code "XXX" and the warn-text "Embedded Warning"
   MUST be returned.

4.  JSON Warning Format

   The proposed response format uses the JSON format described in
   [RFC8259].

   In many current designs of JSON-based HTTP APIs, services represent
   response data as members of the returned JSON object.  Although it
   might seem logical at first, differentiating between data that is
   meant to describe the response of the API call (e.g. a resource
   created) and its errors or other meta data, can get complicated when
   mixed.  Therefore the actual response data SHOULD be returned in a
   data attribute.

4.1.  data

   data: (required) APIs MUST return the data that is tied to the
   resource of the request in this field.  This shields it from other /
   meta content and makes it easily addressable.

   This pattern is already being used by Twitter for getting Tweets [1]
   and Users [2].  Twitter is also using it for handling campaigns [3].

4.2.  request id

   request_id: (required) public id of the request within the API
   providers' system.  The request_id MUST be returned when errors or
   warnings have occurred to make handling of support cases easier.

4.3.  errors

   errors: (optional) When an error occurred that makes it impossible to
   go any further (HTTP response code is in the 4xx-5xx range), the
   errors array MUST be filled with an object for each and every error
   that was thrown.

   Entries follow the pattern described in [RFC7807].

4.4.  warnings

   warnings: (optional) When an error occurred that can not be defined
   as a "hard error" (Section 4.3), but is meant as additional
   information one should consider returning to the APIs user, the
   warnings array MUST be filled with an object for each and every
   warning message that SHOULD be returned to the user.

   Entries follow the pattern described in [RFC7807].

   When warnings are present a warning header (as defined in Section 3)
   MUST be set to indicate that warnings will be returned.  This way a
   client will not have to parse the response body to find out if the
   warnings array has entries.

5.  Correlation between errors, warnings and data

5.1.  Hard errors with warnings

   As described previously, errors are exception like occurrences where
   processing of the request stopped and the API consumer has to be
   informed of this "hard error" right away.





Cedik & Wilde            Expires April 19, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-DrafCommunicating Warning Information in HTTP APIs October 2019


   If warnings occurred during the processing of the request, but before
   the processing stopped, they MUST be returned alongside the errors.

   Due to the fact that the original intent of the API consumer was not
   successful, an empty data object MUST be returned.

   POST /example HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/json

   HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST
   Content-Type: application/json
   Warning: xxx - "Embedded Warning" "Fri, 04 Oct 2019 09:59:45 GMT"

   {
     "request_id": "2326b087-d64e-43bd-a557-42171155084f",
     "errors": [
       {
         "detail": "The format of pickup time earliest was wrong.",
         "errorcode": "4F5G6H",
         "status": "500",
         "title": "Wrong format for pickup time",
         "type": "https://github.com/example/errors/wrong_format"
       }
     ],
     "warnings": [
       {
         "detail": "Street name too long. It has been shortened to fit",
         "errorcode": "123456",
         "status": "200",
         "title": "Street name too long. It has been shortened.",
         "type": "https://github.com/example/errors/shortened_entry"
       }
     ],
     "data": {}
   }

5.2.  Soft errors with data

   Since warnings do not have an effect on the returned http response
   status code, the response status code SHOULD be in the 2xx range,
   indicating that the intent of the API client was successful.

   Because of this a data object (Section 4.1) MUST be returned
   containing the data that was requested.

   Also a warnings array MUST be returned.

       "price": 3.4
     }
   }

6.  Security Considerations

   API providers need to exercise care when reporting errors
   (Section 4.3) or warnings (Section 4.4).  Malicious actors could use
   this information for orchestrating attacks.

Internet-DrafCommunicating Warning Information in HTTP APIs October 2019


   Support teams at API providers need to be informed about the affects
   of social engineering when returning the request_id (Section 4.2),
   because malicious actors could use this information to gain access to
   user specific data.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  HTTP Warn Code: xxx - Embedded Warning

   The HTTP warn code below has been registered by IANA per Section 7.2
   of [RFC7234]:

      Warn Code: xxx

      Short Description: Embedded Warning
