1.  Introduction

   Lots of current APIs are using HTTP [RFC7230] as their protocol.
   Their clients' response handling is based on the assumption, that
   requests either are successful or they fail.  In both cases (success
   and fail) a http response status code [RFC7231] is returned to convey
   the fact.

   But response handling isn't always black and white.  There are use
   cases where a 3rd party system returns a response with data that
   can't be defined as a clear error, but returning a http status code
   of e.g. 200 OK without any additional information is also wrong.
   This document tries to define a standard response format for HTTP API
   warning information.
