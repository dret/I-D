1.  Introduction

   As a general rule, URIs should be stable and persistent, so that
   applications can use them as stable and persistent identifiers for
   resources.  However, there are many scenarios where for a variety of
   reasons, URIs have a limited lifetime.  In some of these scenarios,
   this limited lifetime is known in advance.  In this case, it can be
   useful for clients if resources make this information about their
   limited lifetime known.  This specification defines the Sunset HTTP
   response header field, which indicates that a URI is likely to become
   unresponsive at a specified point in the future.

   Possible scenarios for known lifetimes of resources include, but are
   not limited to the following scenarios.

1.1.  Temporary Resources

   Some resources may have a limited lifetime by definition.  For
   example, a pending order represented by a resource may already list
   all the details of the order, but may only exist for a limited time
   unless it is confirmed and only then becomes permanent.  In such a

Internet-Draft                Sunset Header                   April 2017


   case, the service managing the pending order can make this limited
   lifetime explicit, allowing clients to understand that the pending
   order, unless confirmed, will disappear at some point in time.

1.2.  Migration

   If resources are changing identity because a service migrates them,
   then this may be known in advance.  While it may not yet be
   appropriate to use HTTP redirect status codes (3xx), it may be
   interesting for clients to learn about the service's plan to take
   down the original resource.

1.3.  Retention

   There are many cases where regulation or legislation require that
   resources are kept available for a certain amount of time.  However,
   in many cases there also is a requirement for those resources to be
   permanently deleted after some period of time.  Since the deletion of
   the resource in this scenario is governed by well-defined rules, it
   could be made explicit for clients interacting with the resource.

1.4.  Deprecation

   For Web APIs one standard scenario is that an API or specific subsets
   of an API may get deprecated.  If this is planned in advance, then
   for the time before the actual deprecation is rolled out, the
   resources that will be affected by the deprecation can make the date
   of their deprecation known.  This allows consumers of the API to be
   notified of the upcoming deprecation.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Sunset HTTP Response Header

   The Sunset HTTP response header field allows a server to communicate
   the fact that a resource is expected to become unresponsive at a
   specific point in time.  It provides information for clients which
   they can use to control their usage of the resource.

   The Sunset header contains a single timestamp which advertises the
   point in time when the resource is expected to become unresponsive.
   The Sunset value is an HTTP-date timestamp, as defined in
   Section 7.1.1.1 of [RFC7231].

Internet-Draft                Sunset Header                   April 2017


   Sunset = HTTP-date

   For example

   Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2018 23:59:59 GMT

   Clients SHOULD treat Sunset timestamps as hints: It is not guaranteed
   that the resource will in fact be available until that time, and will
   not be available after that time.  However, since this information is
   provided by the resource itself, it does have some credibility.

   After the Sunset time has arrived, it is likely that interactions
   with the resource will either result in client-side errors (HTTP 4xx
   status codes), or redirect responses (HTTP 3xx status codes).  The
   Sunset header does not expose any information about which of those
   two behaviors can be expected.

   Clients not interpreting an existing Sunset header field can operate
   as usual and simply may experience the resource becoming unavailable
   without getting any notification about it beforehand.

4.  Sunset and Caching

   It should be noted that the Sunset HTTP response header field serves
   a different purpose than HTTP caching [RFC7234].  HTTP caching is
   concerned with making resource representations (i.e., represented
   resource state) reusable, so that they can be more efficiently used.
   This is achieved by using header fields that allow clients and
   intermediaries to better understand when a resource representation
   can be reused, or when resource state (and thus the representation)
   may have changed.

   The Sunset header field is not concerned with resource state at all.
   It only signals that a resource is expected to become unavailable at
   a specific point in time.  There are no assumptions about if, when,
   or how often a resource may change state in the meantime.

   For these reasons, the Sunset header field and HTTP caching should be
   seen as complementary, and not as overlapping in scope and
   functionality.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  The Sunset Response Header

   The Sunset response header should be added to the permanent registry
   of message header fields (see [RFC3864]), taking into account the
   guidelines given by HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231].

6.  Security Considerations

   ...

7.  Example

   Assuming that a resource has been created in an archive that for
   management or compliance reason only stores resources for two years,
   and permanently deletes them afterwards, then the Sunset header field
   can be used to expose this information.  If such a resource has been
   created on November 11, 2014, then the following header field can be
   included in responses:

   Sunset: Fri, 11 Nov 2018 11:11:11 GMT

   This allows clients that are aware of the Sunset header field to
   understand that the resource likely will become unavailable at the
   specified point in time.  Clients can decide to ignore this
   information, adjust their own behavior accordingly, or alert
   applications or users about this timestamp.

   Even though the Sunset header information is made available by the
   resource itself, there is no guarantee that the resource indeed will
   become unavailable, and if so, how the response will look like for
   requests made after that timestamp.  In case of the archive used as
   an example here, the resource indeed may be permanently deleted, and
   requests for the URI after the Sunset timestamp may receive a "410
   Gone" HTTP response.  (This is assuming that the archive keeps track
   of the URIs that it had previously assigned; if not, the response may
   be a more generic "404 Not Found".)

8.  Open Issues

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   o  Human readable explanation: It would be possible to include human-
      readable information about the reason for the URI's disappearance.
      This could either be done inline (probably just a simple string),

Internet-Draft                Sunset Header                   April 2017


      and/or by reference to a URI that will dereference to human-
      readable information.

   o  Machine-readable explanation: It would be possible to include
      machine-readable information about the reason for the URI's
      disappearance.  This could either be done inline (maybe name/value
      pairs), and/or by reference to a URI that will dereference to
      machine-readable information.

   o  New URI: If the resource's new URI is known (for example when a
      service is migrating in a way that invalidates existing URIs, but
      has a plan of how these will map to new URIs), then that URI could
      be advertised in advance (i.e., it is not yet a 3xx, but clients
      might want to start working with the new URI anyway).

   o  Timestamp in the past: Should it be allowed to have timestamps in
      the past?  Maybe either disallow them, or specifically allow them
      and explain what they mean, for example the fact that a resource
      that now is redirecting can expose information about when it
      changed from being the primary resource to being the redirection.

   o  Sunrise: If resources have planned outages (server maintenance,
      for example), then they might not just have a sunset to advertise,
      but also a sunrise.  This would allow consumers to learn about how
      long a resource might be unavailable.
