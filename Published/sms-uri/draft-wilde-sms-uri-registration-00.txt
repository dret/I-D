Abstract

   This memo requests the registration of the Universal Resource
   Identifier (URI) scheme "sms" for specifying a recipient (and
   optionally a gateway) for an SMS message.  SMS messages are two-way
   paging messages that can be sent from and received by a mobile phone
   or a suitably equipped computer.

Internet-Draft               SMS URI Scheme                     Mar 2006


1.  URI Scheme Name

   sms


2.  Status

   Provisional


3.  URI Scheme Syntax

   See [draft-wilde-sms-uri-12].


4.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The "sms" URI scheme defines a URI scheme which does not directly
   address a resource.  Thus, the usual operations that may be performed
   on resources do not apply.  Instead, the "sms" defines a way how a
   message may be composed which is then transmitted using the SMS
   message transmission method.  This scheme can thus be compared to be
   "mailto" URI scheme [RFC2368].  See [draft-wilde-sms-uri-12] for the
   details of operation.


5.  Encoding Considerations

   The optional body field of "sms" URIs may contain a message text, but
   this text uses percent-encoded UTF-8 characters and thus can always
   be represented using URI characters.  See [draft-wilde-sms-uri-12]
   for the details of encoding.


6.  Applications/Protocols that use this URI Scheme Name

   The "sms" URI scheme is intended to be used in a similar way as the
   "mailto" URI scheme [RFC2368].  By using "sms" URIs, authors can
   embed information into documents which can be used as a starting
   point for initiating message composition.  Whether the client is
   sending the message itself (for example over a GSM air interface) or
   redirecting the user to a third party for message composition (such
   as a Web service for sending SMS messages) is outside of the scope of
   the URI scheme definition.


7.  Interoperability Considerations

   No interoperability issues have been identified.


8.  Security Considerations

   See [draft-wilde-sms-uri-12].
