   <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
         <t>One of the defining aspects of the Web is that it is possible to
	 interact with Web resources without any prior knowledge of the
	 specifics of the resource. Following the practices described in Web architecture <xref
	 target="W3C.REC-webarch-20041215"/> by using URIs, HTTP, and media
	 types, the Web's uniform interface allows interactions with resources
	 without the more complex binding procedures often necessary with
	 other approaches.</t> 

         <t>Many resources on the Web are provided as part of a set of
	 resources that are referred to as a "Web service" or a "Web API". In
	 many cases, these services or APIs are defined and managed as a
	 whole, and it may be desirable for clients to be able to discover
	 this service information.</t> 

         <t>Service information that provides information on how to use
	 service resources can be broadly separated into two categories: One
	 category primarily targets human users and often uses generic
	 representations for human readable documents, such as HTML or
	 PDF. The other category is structured information that follows a more
	 formalized description model and is primarily intended for
	 consumption by machines -- for example, tools and code libraries.</t>

         <t>In the context of this memo, the human-oriented variant is
	 referred to as "documentation", and the machine-oriented variant is
	 referred to as "description".</t> 

         <t>These two categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as
	 representations have been proposed that are intended for both human
	 consumption and interpretation by machine clients. In addition, a
	 typical pattern for service documentation/description is that there
	 is human-oriented, high-level documentation that is intended to put a
	 service in context and explain the general model, which is
	 complemented by a machine-level description that is intended as a
	 detailed technical description of the service. These two resources
	 could be interlinked, but since they are intended for different
	 audiences, it can make sense to provide entry points for both of
	 them.</t> 

         <t>In addition, while both documentation and descriptions may be
	 provided as part of a Web service, there may be other information as
	 well. Generally speaking, a Web service may have any
	 metadata/resources associated with it (with documentation and description
	 being two specific kinds of resources). If there is a way in which
	 all of these metadata/resources can be represented, then it should 
	 be possible to find such a resource that provides access to general
	 Web service metadata.</t> 

         <t>In addition to these resources about mostly static aspects of a
	 Web service, this memo also defines a link relation that allows
	 providers of a Web service to link to a resource that represents
	 status information about the service. This information often
	 represents operational information that allows service consumers to
	 retrieve information about "service health" and related issues.</t> 

         <t>This memo places no constraints on the specific representations
	 used for all of these resources. It simply allows providers of a Web
	 service to make the documentation, description, metadata, and status
	 of their services discoverable and defines link relations that serve
	 that purpose.</t>

         <t>"Web Services" or "Web APIs" (sometimes also referred to as "HTTP

	 the Web. Following the principles of Web architecture <xref
	 target="W3C.REC-webarch-20041215"/>, they expose URI-identified
	 resources, which are then accessed and transferred using a specific
	 representation. Many services use representations that contain links,
	 and these links are often typed links.</t> 
         <t>Using typed links, resources can identify relationship types to
	 other resources. RFC 8288 <xref target="RFC8288"/> establishes a
	 framework of registered link relation types, which are identified by
	 simple strings and registered in an IANA registry. Any resource that
	 supports typed links according to RFC 8288 can then use these
	 identifiers to represent resource relationships on the Web without
	 having to reinvent registered relation types.</t> 
         <t>In recent years, Web services, as well as their documentation and
	 description languages, have gained popularity due to the general
	 popularity of the Web as a platform for providing information and
	 services. However, the design of documentation and description
	 languages varies according to a number of factors, such as the
	 general application domain, the preferred application data model, and
	 the preferred approach for exposing services.</t> 
         <t>This specification allows service providers to use a unified method
	 to link to service documentation and/or description. This link should
	 not make any assumptions about the provided type of documentation
	 and/or description, so service providers can choose those that

         <section title="Describing Web Services" anchor="desc-web-services">
           <t>In the context of this specification, "description" refers to
	   information that is primarily intended for machine
	   consumption. Typical representations are dictated by the technology
	   underlying the service itself, which means that description formats
	   in today's technology landscape are based on XML, JSON, Resource
	   Description Framework (RDF), and a
	   variety of other structured data models. In each of those
	   technologies, there may be a variety of languages defined to serve the same
	   general purpose of describing a Web service.</t> 
            <t>Descriptions are always structured, but the structuring
	    principles depend on the nature of the described service. For
	    example, one of the earlier service description approaches, the
	    Web Services Description Language (WSDL), uses "operations" as its
	    core concept, which are essentially identical to function calls
	    because the underlying model is based on the Remote Procedure Call
	    (RPC) model. Other description languages for non-RPC approaches to
	    services will use different structuring approaches, such as
	    structuring service descriptions by URIs and/or URI patterns.</t>

	    two separate links. In such a case, an alternative approach is to
	    use the previously defined "service" link relation type <xref
	    target="RFC5023"/>, which does not indicate whether it links to

	 relation types.</t> 
         <section title="The service-doc Link Relation Type" anchor="link-rel-service-doc">
            <t>The "service-doc" link relation type is used to represent the
	    fact that a resource or a set of resources is documented at a
	    specific URI. The target resource is expected to provide
	    documentation that is primarily intended for human
	    consumption.</t> 
         </section>
         <section title="The service-desc Link Relation Type" anchor="link-rel-service-desc">
            <t>The "service-desc" link relation type is used to represent the
	    fact that a resource or a set of resources is described at a
	    specific URI. The target resource is expected to provide a service
	    description that is primarily intended for machine consumption. In
	    many cases, it is provided in a representation that is consumed by
	    tools, code libraries, or similar components.</t> 
         </section>
         <section title="The service-meta Link Relation Type" anchor="link-rel-service-meta">
            <t>The "service-meta" link relation type is used to link to
	    available metadata for the service context of a resource. Service
	    metadata is any kind of data that may be of interest to existing
	    or potential service users, with documentation/description being
	    only two possible facets of service metadata. The target resource
	    is expected to provide a representation that is primarily intended
	    for machine consumption. In many cases, it is provided in a
	    representation that is consumed by tools, code libraries, or
	    similar components.</t> 
            <t>Since service metadata can have many different purposes and use
	    many different representations, it may make sense for
	    representations using the "service-meta" link relation to offer
	    additional hints about the specific kind or format of metadata
	    that is being linked. This definition of the "service-meta" link
	    relation makes no specific assumptions about how these link hints
	    will be represented, and the specific mechanism will depend on the
	    context where the "service-meta" link relation is being used.</t> 
            <t>One example is that a "service-desc" link may identify an
	    OpenAPI description, which is supposed to be the machine-readable
	    description of a Web API. A "service-meta" link may identify a
	    resource that contains additional metadata about the Web API, such
	    as labels that classify the API according to a labeling scheme and
	    a privacy policy that makes statements about how the Web API
	    manages personally identifiable information.</t> 
         </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Web Service Status Resources" anchor="link-rel-status">
         <t>Web services providing access to one or more resources often are
	 hosted and operated in an environment for which status information
	 may be available. This information may be as simple as confirming
	 that a service is operational, or it may provide additional
	 information about different aspects of a service and/or a history of
	 status information, possibly listing incidents and their
	 resolution.</t> 
         <t>The "status" link relation type can be used to link to such a
	 status resource, allowing service consumers to retrieve information
	 about a Web service's status. Such a link may not be 
	 available for and from all resources provided by a Web service --
	 only from key resources such as a Web service's metadata resource
	 and/or a service's home resource (i.e., a resource analogous to the
	 home page of a Web site).</t> 
         <t>This memo does not restrict the representation of a status
	 resource in any way. It may be primarily focused on human or machine
	 consumption or a combination of both. It may be a simple "traffic
	 light" indicator for service health or a more sophisticated
	 representation conveying more detailed information, such as service
	 subsystems and/or a status history.</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security-considerations">
         <t>Web service providers should be aware that service descriptions
	 and documentation may be used by attackers to gain additional
	 information about a service (particularly its implementation) and to
	 test for known security issues. It may thus be advisable to restrict
	 service descriptions and documentation to aspects of a service that
	 are necessary and to exclude any details that
	 are not necessary for using the service.</t>
         <t>Another potential security issue for Web service providers is that
	 publishing service descriptions and documentation may generally allow
	 clients (both malicious and otherwise) more automated and systematic
	 access to a service. It may therefore be possible that more of a
	 service's potential vulnerabilities are made easier to find and
	 exploit or simply that a service might receive more load because it
	 is accessed by automated clients.</t> 
         <t>Web service consumers should be aware that service descriptions
	 and documentation can be out of sync or simply incorrect. Blindly
	 trusting service descriptions and documentation (particularly when
	 descriptions are retrieved and interpreted programmatically) is not a
	 safe practice. Web service consumers SHOULD always assume that
	 service descriptions and documentation may be incorrect and SHOULD
	 therefore be prepared to handle errors at runtime.</t>
