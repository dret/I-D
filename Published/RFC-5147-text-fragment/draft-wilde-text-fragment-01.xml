		<abstract>
			<t>This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/plain resources. These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to parts of a text resource, identified by character count or range, line count or range, or a regular expression. These identification methods can be combined to identify more than one sub-resource of a text/plain resource.</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>Compliant software MUST follow this specification. The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
			<section title="What is text/plain?">
				<t>Internet Media Types as defined in RFC 2045 <xref target="RFC2045"/> and RFC 2046 <xref target="RFC2046"/> are used to identify different types and sub-types of media. RFC 2046 <xref target="RFC2046"/> and RFC 2646 <xref target="RFC2646"/> specify the text/plain media type, which is used for simple, unformatted text. Quoting from RFC 2046 <xref target="RFC2046"/>: "Plain text does not provide for or allow  formatting commands, font attribute specifications, processing instructions, interpretation directives, or content markup. Plain text is seen simply as a linear sequence of characters, possibly
   interrupted by line breaks or page breaks."</t>
				<t>The text/plain media type does not restrict the character encoding, any character encoding may be used. In the absence of an explicit character encoding declaration, US-ASCII is assumed as the default character encoding. This variability of the character encoding makes it impossible to count characters in a text/plain resource without taking the character encoding into account, because there are many character encodings using more than one octet per character.</t>
				<t>The biggest advantage of text/plain resources is their portability among different platforms. As long as they use popular character encodings (such as US-ASCII), they can be displayed and processed on virtually every computer system.</t>
				<section title="Line Endings in text/plain Resources" anchor="lineending">
					<t>RFC 2046 <xref target="RFC2046"/> and RFC 2646 <xref target="RFC2646"/> specify that line endings in text/plain resources are represented by CR+LF character sequences. In implementation practice, however, text/plain resources use different conventions, for example depending on the operating system they have been created with (in most cases, Unix uses LF, MacOS uses CR, and Windows uses CR+LF). Because of this diversity of conventions, implementations interpreting text/plain fragment identifiers MUST take different line ending conventions into account.</t>
					<t>Line endings in text/plain resources MAY be represented by other character (sequences) than CR+LF, specifically CR, LF, NEL, and CR+NEL. All these character (sequences) MUST be interpreted as line endings. This interpretation MUST affect the evaluation of text/plain fragment identifiers. All representations of line endings (CR+LF, CR, LF, NEL, and CR+NEL) MUST be treated as a LF line ending (ie, a single character) in character counts and regular expressions. The reason for this is that fragment identifiers should not be broken by converting a file from one line ending convention to another.</t>
				</section>

			<section title="What is a URI Fragment Identifier?">
				<t>URIs are the identification mechanism for resources on the Web. The URI syntax specified in RFC 2396 <xref target="RFC2396"/> includes as part of a URI reference a fragment identifier, which (quoting from RFC 2396 <xref target="RFC2396"/>) "consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully completed.  As such, it is not part of a URI, but is often used in conjunction with a URI. The semantics of a fragment identifier is a property of the data resulting from a retrieval action, regardless of the type of URI used in the reference.  Therefore, the format and interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type of the retrieval result."</t>
				<t>The most popular fragment identifier is defined for text/html (defined in RFC 2854 <xref target="RFC2854"/>), and makes it possible to refer to a specific element (identified by a 'name' or 'id' attribute) of an HTML document.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Why text/plain Fragment Identifiers?">
				<t>Referring to specific parts of a resource can be very useful, because it enables users to create more specific references. Rather than pointing to a whole resource, users can create references to the part they really are interested in or want to talk about. Even though it is suggested that fragment identification methods are specified in a media type's MIME registration, many media types do not have fragment identification methods associated with them.</t>
				<t>Fragment identifiers are only useful if supported by the client, because they are only interpreted by the client. Therefore, a new fragment identification method will require some time to be adopted by clients, and older clients will not support it. However, because the URI reference still works even if the fragment identifier is not supported (the resource is retrieved, but the fragment identifier is not interpreted), rapid adoption is not highly critical to ensure the success of a new fragment identification method.</t>
				<t>Fragment identifiers for text/plain make it possible to refer to specific parts of a text resource, either by line count, by character count, or by using a regular expression for searching for a specific character sequence. Thus, text/plain fragment identifiers enable users to exchange information more specifically, thereby reducing time and effort that is necessary to manually search for the relevant part of a text/plain resource.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Incremental Deployment" anchor="incremental">
				<t>As long as support for text/plain fragment identifiers is not implemented by all programs, it is important to consider the implications of incremental deployment. Clients (for example, Web browsers) not supporting the trext/plain fragment identifier described in this memo will work with URI references to text/plain resources, but they will fail to locate the sub-resource identified by the fragment identifier. This is a reasonable fallback behavior, and in general users should take into account the possibility that a program interpreting a given URI reference will fail to interpret the fragment identifier part (this is a general principle which applies to fragment identifiers for all kinds of resources).</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Fragment Identification Methods">
			<t>The identification of resource fragments of text/plain resources can be based on different foundations. Since it is not necessary to insert explicit identifiers into a text/plain resource (as is possible with HTML documents by using special attributes), fragment identification has to rely on certain inherent criteria of the resource. This memo specifies fragment identification using five different methods, character counts and ranges, line counts and ranges, and regular expression matching.</t>
			<t> When interpreting character or line numbers, implementations MUST take the character encoding of the resource into account, because character count and octet count may differ for the character encoding being used. For example, a resource using UTF-16 encoding (as specified in RFC 2718 <xref target="RFC2781"/>) uses two octets per character, and it may have a leading BOM (Byte-Order Mark) which does not count as a character and thus also affects the mapping from a simple octet count to a character count.</t>
			<section title="Fragment Identification Schemes">
				<section title="Character Count" anchor="charchount">
					<t>The simplest way to identify a fragment is to point to a certain character of the resource. Rather than identifying a fragment consisting of a number of characters, this method only identifies a single character, but this often is sufficient by referring to the start of a region of interest. Character counting starts with 1, so the first character of a text/plain resource has the count 1.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Character Range" anchor="charrange">
					<t>If it is necessary to identify a fragment of multiple characters using character counting, this can be done by using a character range. A character range is a consecutive region of the resource that extends from the starting character of the range to the ending character of the range. The ending character of the range must have a greater number than the starting character.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Line Count" anchor="linecount">
					<t>Lines in text/plain resources are separated by line endings (<xref target="lineending"/> describes how line endings MUST be identified), and consequently it is easy to identify lines. Because lines are the only structural property of text/plain resources, it is possible to identify a fragment of a resource by referring to a particular line. Line counting starts with 1, so the first line of a text/plain resource has the count 1. If a resource does not contain any line endings, then it consists of a single (the first) line.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Line Range" anchor="linerange">
					<t>If it is necessary to identify a fragment of multiple lines using line counting, this can be done by using a line range. A line range is a consecutive region of the resource that extends from the starting line of the range to the ending line of the range. The ending line of the range must have a greater number than the starting line.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="Regular Expressions" anchor="regex">
					<t>A common problem with fragment identifiers is their robustness (to changes in the resource), and character and line counts can be broken very easily. A more robust way of identifying a fragment is by searching for a specific pattern. Thus, it is possible to use a Basic Regular Expression (BRE) as defined by ISO 9945-2 <xref target="ISO9945-2"/> (the POSIX standard) as a fragment identifier (<xref target="BRE"/> contains a short summary of the POSIX BRE syntax).</t>
				</section>
				<section anchor="combining" title="Combining Fragment Identification Schemes"/>
				<t>While in most cases only one fragment identification scheme will be used, it is possible to combine them. By simply concatenating different fragment identification schemes, the whole fragment identifier refers to the union of all parts of the text resource identified by the individual fragment identification schemes. This way, it is possible to identify disjoint ranges, such as multiple line ranges.</t>
				<t>It should be noticed that regular expressions by themselves may identify disjoint fragments, which is true in any case where the regular expression matches more than one occurrence in the resource.</t>
				<t>Since disjoint fragments can be identified, implementations SHOULD make sure that these fragments are appropriately marked, for example by highlighting the fragment (rather than only scrolling to some line, which only identifies a single location in the resource). However, the exact method of how implementations deal with disjoint fragments depends on the application and interface, and is beyond the scope of this memo.</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Fragment Identification Syntax">
			<t>The syntax for the fragment identifiers is very straightforward. The syntax defines three schemes, 'char', 'line', and 'match'. The 'char' and 'line' can be used in two different variants, either the count variant (with a single number), or the range variant (with two comma-separated numbers). The 'match' scheme has a regular expression as parameter, which must be specified as a string with balanced parentheses.</t>
			<t>The following syntax definition uses ABNF as defined in RFC 2234 <xref target="RFC2234"/>.</t>
			<t>
				<figure>
					<artwork>
text-fragment =  1*text-scheme
text-scheme   =  ( char-scheme / line-scheme / regex-scheme )
char-scheme   =  "char(" ( count / range ) ")"
line-scheme   =  "line(" ( count / range ) ")"
match-scheme  =  "match(" regex ")"
count         =  1*DIGIT
range         =  count "," [ count ]
regex         =  StringWithBalancedParens
					</artwork>
				</figure>
			</t>
			<t>The StringWithBalancedParens may only contain balanced parentheses, if unbalanced parentheses need to be used, they must be escaped with a '^' character. A literal '^' must be escaped as '^^'. Thus, before interpreting the StringWithBalancedParens as a BRE, it must be searched for '^(', '^)', and '^^', and these strings must be substituted with their unescaped variants.</t>
			<t>Escaping with '^' is used because ongoing work for a generic fragment identifier syntax <xref target="genfrag"/> is using this convention, and it is already being used in XML XPointer fragment identifiers <xref target="xpointer"/>.</t>
			<section title="Handling of count Values">
				<t>If any count value is greater than the value for the actual resource, then it identifies the last character or line of the resource. If the second count value in a range is not present, then the range extends to the end of the resource. If a range scheme's counts are not properly ordered (ie, the first number is less than the second), then this scheme part has to be ignored.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Non-ASCII Characters in Regular Expressions">
				<t>RFC 2396 <xref target="RFC2396"/> does not define how to use non-ASCII characters in URIs. Consequently, it is not possible to use non-ASCII characters in URIs in a standardized and reliable way. However, work on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) <xref target="IRI"/> is in progress, and as soon as this work results in a published RFC, it will be possible to use non-ASCII characters in regular expressions, using the encoding defined by IRI.</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section title="Examples">
			<t>The following examples show some usages for the fragment identifiers defined in this memo.</t>
			<t>
				<figure>
					<artwork>
http://example.com/text.txt#char(100)
					</artwork>
				</figure>
			</t>
			<t>This URI reference identifies the 100th character of the text.txt resource. It should be noted that it is not clear which octet(s) of the resource this will be without retrieving the resource and thus knowing which character encoding is used for it (in case of HTTP, this information will be given in the response's Content-type header).</t>
			<t>
				<figure>
					<artwork>
http://example.com/text.txt#line(10,20)
					</artwork>
				</figure>
			</t>
			<t>This URI reference identifies lines 10 to 20 of the text.txt resource. If the resource has fewer than 10 lines, it identifies the last line. If the resource has less than 20 but at least 10 lines, it identifies the lines 10 to the last line of the resource.</t>
			<t>
				<figure>
					<artwork>
http://example.com/text.txt#match(searchterm)
					</artwork>
				</figure>
			</t>
			<t>This URI reference identifies all occurrences of the regular expression 'searchterm' in the resource, ie all occurrences of the string 'searchterm'. If there is more than one occurrence, then this URI references a disjoint fragment, consisting of all of these occurrences.</t>
			<t>
				<figure>
					<artwork>
http://example.com/text.txt#line(1)match(searchterm)
					</artwork>
				</figure>
			</t>
			<t>This URI reference identifies the first line and all occurrences of the regular expression 'searchterm' in the resource. If there is an occurrence of 'searchterm' outside of the first line, then this URI references a disjoint fragment.</t>
			<t>
				<figure>
					<artwork>
http://example.com/text.txt#match(hello%5E()
					</artwork>
				</figure>
			</t>
			<t>This URI reference identifies all occurrences of the regular expression 'hello(' in the resource. It must first be URL decoded, which leads to the scheme part 'hello^('. This is then interpreted according to the definition of a string with balanced parentheses, treating the '^(' as an escaped '(', so that the actual regular expression is 'hello('.  If there is more than one occurrence of this regular expression, then this URI references a disjoint fragment, consisting of all of these occurrences.</t>
			<t>

		<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
			<t>Regular expression matching code is notoriously vulnerable to buffer overflow security holes, so any implementation supporting text/plain fragment identifiers SHOULD make sure that the code being used (or being written) has been tested against buffer overflow attacks using match() scheme fragment identifiers.</t>
